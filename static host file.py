                Betal put forward another puzzle to Vikram. A woman called Leelavati married a thief. After marriage the man decided to quit stealing. However, when they had a son, the man found he had no money to support his family and went back to stealing. After his death, Leelavati married a businessman.
                The businessman loved his family and raised the child well. Just when the boy took charge of the business, his parents died.
                While performing their last rites in the river, three hands came out claiming the offering. The boy recognised his mother's voice and offered prayers to her, but he couldn't make out which pair of hand was his father's. At this point he recalled his mother once mentioning his real father.
                Betal stopped the story here and asked which father was finally given the offering.
                "The businessman," replied Vikram. "Because he had showered his love and reared the child, while the thief had only given him birth." Again, Betal flew away.

                One day Thomas Edison came home and gave a paper to his mother. He told her, “My teacher gave this paper to me and told me to only give it to my mother.” His mother’s eyes were tearful as she read the letter out loud to her child, “Your son is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn’t have enough good teachers for training him. Please teach him yourself.”
                Many years after Edison’s mother had died, Edison had become one of the greatest inventors of the century. One day he was going through the old closet and he found a folded letter which was given to him by his teacher for his mother. He opened it. The message written on the letter was, “Your son is mentally ill. We can not let him attend our school anymore. He is expelled.”
                Edison became emotional reading it and then he wrote in his diary, “Thomas Alva Edison was a mentally ill child whose mother turned him into the genius of the century.”

                My mother's most generous gift is giving all her time and self to my family.
                Some background, my parents are immigrants from South Korea. They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.


                That is how generous my mother is. She gives all she has to us, and more.

                An 80 year old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45 year’s old highly educated son.
                Suddenly a crow perched on their window.
                The Father asked his Son, “What is this?”
                The Son replied “It is a crow”.
                After a few minutes, the Father asked his Son the 2nd time, “What is this?”
                The Son said “Father, I have just now told you “It’s a crow”.
                After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son the 3rd time,
                What is this?”
                At this time some expression of irritation was felt in the Son’s tone when he said to his Father with a rebuff. “It’s a crow, a crow, a crow”.
                A little after, the Father again asked his Son the 4th time, “What is this?
                This time the Son shouted at his Father, “Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times ‘IT IS A CROW’.
                Are you not able to understand this?”
                A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:-
                “Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. 
                I did not at all feel irritated I rather felt affection for my innocent child”. 
                While the little child asked him 23 times “What is this”, the Father had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the Son felt irritated and annoyed.
                From today say this aloud, “I want to see my parents happy forever. They have cared for me ever since I was a little child.
                They have always showered their selfless love on me.

                A student asks a teacher, “Why often people marry a different person then they fell in love with?”  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the wheat field and choose the best wheat and come back.  But the rule is that you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the field, went through the first row, he saw one big wheat which he instantly liked, but he wonders that maybe there is a bigger one further.  Then he saw another bigger one, but again he thought that maybe there is an even bigger one waiting for him.
                Later, when he finished more than half of the wheat field, he started to realize that the wheat is not as big as the ones he let go off, he started to realize that he had missed the best one in the search of a bigger.  So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.  This is the mistake often made by people who fell in love and lost the best person they could have in their life”.
                So, the student said, “Does that mean, one should never fall in love?”  The Teacher replied, “No Dear,  Anyone can fall in love if they find a suitable person.  But, once you truly fall in love, you must never let go of that person due to your anger, ego or comparisons with others”.
                “How do they end up marrying someone other than they loved?” the student asked.  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the corn field and choose the biggest corn and come back. But the rule is same as before, you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the corn field, this time he was careful to not to repeat the previous mistake.  When he reached to the middle of the field, he picked one medium corn that he felt satisfied with and went back to the teacher.  He described how he made a choice.  The teacher told him, “This time you didn’t came empty handed.  You looked for one that is just nice, and you had put your faith that this is the best one you can get.  This is how one makes a choice for marriage.”
                The student stood confused.  The teacher asked, “What is bothering you now?”  The student replied, “I am wondering which would have been better, marrying a person you love or loving the person you marry”.  The teacher replied, “It’s a very easy answer, only if you are willing to admit it to yourself”.

                Two inseparable friends, Sam and Jason, met with an accident on their way to Boston City. The following morning, Jason woke up blind and Sam was still unconscious. Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me. "Dr Berkeley was moved at Sam's deed. All that he could say was, "You are a very brave man Sam and God will make it up to you in one way or another". While he was moving on to the next patient, Sam called back at him almost pleading, "promise me you won't tell Jason anything".
                "You know I won't do that. Trust me." and walked away.
                "Thank you " whispered Sam. He smiled and looked up in prayer " I hope I live up to your ideas...please give me the strength to be able to go through this..Amen"
                Months later when Jason had recuperated considerably, he stopped hanging around with Sam. He felt discouraged and embarrassed to spend time with a disabled person like Sam.
                Sam was lonely and disheartened ,since he didn't have any body else other than Jason to count on. Things went from bad to worse. And one day Sam died in despair. When Jason was called on his burial, he found a letter waiting for him. Dr Berkeley gave it to him with an expressionless face and said" This is for you Jason. Sam had asked me to give it to you when he was gone". 
                In the letter he had said: " Dear Jason, I have kept my promise in the end to lend you my eyes if anything had happened to them. Now there is nothing more that I can ask from God, than the fact,that will see the world through my eyes. You will always be my best friend........Sam".
                When he had finished reading Dr. Berkeley said " I had promised Sam to keep his sacrifice he made a secret from you. But now I wish I didn't stick it Because I don't think It was worthy it".
                All that was left for Jason while he stood there was tears of regret and memories of Sam for the rest of his life.

                Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
                Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for you, Daddy.”
                The man became embarrassed by his overreaction earlier, but his rage continue when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her; “Don’t you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside?”
                The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried;
                “Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They’re all for you, Daddy.”

                A poem of loving Uncle:

                Mother's brother
                Took me in as his daughter
                Wiped the tears from my face
                Father took off, so he filled his place
                No questions about his loyalty
                The love he shows already answered them for me
                Day and night I bow and pray
                Giving God praise for letting him stay in my life another day
                My protector when life gets rough
                No one can break our bond, because it's strong and tough
                In his eyes he reveals a secret
                Something that is so beautiful, but only we share it
                His love is pure, like no other
                Thank you grandma for having my mother's brother.

                It was a crisp morning on June 15th,2005 when I got a call from my father, “Its a girl” he said. My joy knew no bounds and I danced around my balcony announcing the news of the new arrival to my neighbors.         
                My elder sister, Smitha(26yrs), delivered a girl on June 15th,2005. It was such a blessing for all of us. She stayed with us through her pregnancy and it was a wonderful bonding time for us. I would take care of her sleep, food, etc and be extra cautious to her. I even decorated my room with posters showcasing ‘cute’ babies.
                I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                Why, out of all the girls he had, did he have to choose to hurt me?” The girl cried, showed the bruises which she did because of him.She came back to reality as familiar fingers caressed her hair, the other hand tracing patterns on her arm.
                “Do you want me to be honest?” I asked, wiping her tears, holding her hands. she nodded and moved her head but she wants to listen.
                “Well..” She began, putting her arms around me in a warm embrace. 
                “You are innocent. You are beautiful; unused. I think he liked that. All of the other girls he’d met had been screwed over already. But you were pure. Too pure for his dirty hands.”
                Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                She will teach me to do the right things,

                She will guide me through the right path,

                She will motivate me during my bad times,

                She will pray for me and for my future,

                She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

    The Boy and The Nails
                A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''


    story2=  '''
    Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                No scolding, no timeouts
                It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                Playing soccer with your head
                Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                Why don’t you hit me?
                Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

    Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

    Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                Moral of the story:

                Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

    A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.

    One night a snake... while it was looking for food, entered a carpenter’s workshop.
                The carpenter, who was a rather untidy man, had left several of his tools lying on the floor.

                One of them was a saw. As it went around inside the shop, the snake climbed over the saw, which gave it a little cut.

                At once, thinking that the saw was attacking it, the snake turned around and bit it so hard that its mouth started to bleed, enraging the snake even more. The snake continued to attack the saw over and over again until the saw was covered with the snake’s blood. Sadly, the snake did not realize what was actually happening.

                Dying from its own wounds, the snake decided to wrap itself around the saw and began to squeeze with all its strength but alas! it ended up killing itself.

                Sometimes during certain life situations, we react with anger not realizing that we are only hurting ourselves. In life it's better to sometimes ignore situations, people and their behavior. People say and do things but it's our decision whether to react in a positive or in a negative way.

                The carpenter and his tools in this story are like those unpolished, insensitive people and their equally insensitive utterances that cut us in the heart, hurt our sentiments, and cause us emotional damage. But it is up to us to either ignore them and go our way without letting their words touch/harm us or to react foolishly like the snake in this story and end up in a miserable condition due to our short-temper.

                “Soft answers remove anger, Rough words raise rage.”
                I would also say to all foster mom or aunts to understand that they are hurting themselves in a long run'''

                The ripple effects of anger
                "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.

                "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                The ripple effects of anger2
                His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

                Betal put forward another puzzle to Vikram. A woman called Leelavati married a thief. After marriage the man decided to quit stealing. However, when they had a son, the man found he had no money to support his family and went back to stealing. After his death, Leelavati married a businessman.
                The businessman loved his family and raised the child well. Just when the boy took charge of the business, his parents died.
                While performing their last rites in the river, three hands came out claiming the offering. The boy recognised his mother's voice and offered prayers to her, but he couldn't make out which pair of hand was his father's. At this point he recalled his mother once mentioning his real father.
                Betal stopped the story here and asked which father was finally given the offering.
                "The businessman," replied Vikram. "Because he had showered his love and reared the child, while the thief had only given him birth." Again, Betal flew away.

                One day Thomas Edison came home and gave a paper to his mother. He told her, “My teacher gave this paper to me and told me to only give it to my mother.” His mother’s eyes were tearful as she read the letter out loud to her child, “Your son is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn’t have enough good teachers for training him. Please teach him yourself.”
                Many years after Edison’s mother had died, Edison had become one of the greatest inventors of the century. One day he was going through the old closet and he found a folded letter which was given to him by his teacher for his mother. He opened it. The message written on the letter was, “Your son is mentally ill. We can not let him attend our school anymore. He is expelled.”

                My mother's most generous gift is giving all her time and self to my family.
                Some background, my parents are immigrants from South Korea. They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.

                An 80 year old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45 year’s old highly educated son.
                Suddenly a crow perched on their window.
                The Father asked his Son, “What is this?”

                After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son the 3rd time,
                What is this?”
                At this time some expression of irritation was felt in the Son’s tone when he said to his Father with a rebuff. “It’s a crow, a crow, a crow”.
                A little after, the Father again asked his Son the 4th time, “What is this?
                This time the Son shouted at his Father, “Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times ‘IT IS A CROW’.
                Are you not able to understand this?”
                A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:-
                “Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. 
                I did not at all feel irritated I rather felt affection for my innocent child”. 
                While the little child asked him 23 times “What is this”, the Father had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the Son felt irritated and annoyed.

                They have always showered their selfless love on me.

                A student asks a teacher, “Why often people marry a different person then they fell in love with?”  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the wheat field and choose the best wheat and come back.  But the rule is that you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the field, went through the first row, he saw one big wheat which he instantly liked, but he wonders that maybe there is a bigger one further.  Then he saw another bigger one, but again he thought that maybe there is an even bigger one waiting for him.
                Later, when he finished more than half of the wheat field, he started to realize that the wheat is not as big as the ones he let go off, he started to realize that he had missed the best one in the search of a bigger.  So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.  This is the mistake often made by people who fell in love and lost the best person they could have in their life”.
                So, the student said, “Does that mean, one should never fall in love?”  The Teacher replied, “No Dear,  Anyone can fall in love if they find a suitable person.  But, once you truly fall in love, you must never let go of that person due to your anger, ego or comparisons with others”.
                “How do they end up marrying someone other than they loved?” the student asked.  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the corn field and choose the biggest corn and come back. But the rule is same as before, you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the corn field, this time he was careful to not to repeat the previous mistake.  When he reached to the middle of the field, he picked one medium corn that he felt satisfied with and went back to the teacher.  He described how he made a choice.  The teacher told him, “This time you didn’t came empty handed.  You looked for one that is just nice, and you had put your faith that this is the best one you can get.  This is how one makes a choice for marriage.”
                The student stood confused.  The teacher asked, “What is bothering you now?”  The student replied, “I am wondering which would have been better, marrying a person you love or loving the person you marry”.

                Two inseparable friends, Sam and Jason, met with an accident on their way to Boston City. The following morning, Jason woke up blind and Sam was still unconscious. Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me. "Dr Berkeley was moved at Sam's deed. All that he could say was, "You are a very brave man Sam and God will make it up to you in one way or another". While he was moving on to the next patient, Sam called back at him almost pleading, "promise me you won't tell Jason anything".
                "You know I won't do that. Trust me." and walked away.
                "Thank you " whispered Sam. He smiled and looked up in prayer " I hope I live up to your ideas...please give me the strength to be able to go through this..Amen"
                Months later when Jason had recuperated considerably, he stopped hanging around with Sam. He felt discouraged and embarrassed to spend time with a disabled person like Sam.
                Sam was lonely and disheartened ,since he didn't have any body else other than Jason to count on. Things went from bad to worse. And one day Sam died in despair. When Jason was called on his burial, he found a letter waiting for him. Dr Berkeley gave it to him with an expressionless face and said" This is for you Jason. Sam had asked me to give it to you when he was gone". 
                In the letter he had said: " Dear Jason, I have kept my promise in the end to lend you my eyes if anything had happened to them. Now there is nothing more that I can ask from God, than the fact,that will see the world through my eyes. You will always be my best friend........Sam".
                When he had finished reading Dr. Berkeley said " I had promised Sam to keep his sacrifice he made a secret from you. But now I wish I didn't stick it Because I don't think It was worthy it".

                It was a crisp morning on June 15th,2005 when I got a call from my father, “Its a girl” he said. My joy knew no bounds and I danced around my balcony announcing the news of the new arrival to my neighbors.         
                My elder sister, Smitha(26yrs), delivered a girl on June 15th,2005. It was such a blessing for all of us. She stayed with us through her pregnancy and it was a wonderful bonding time for us. I would take care of her sleep, food, etc and be extra cautious to her. I even decorated my room with posters showcasing ‘cute’ babies.
                I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                Why, out of all the girls he had, did he have to choose to hurt me?” The girl cried, showed the bruises which she did because of him.She came back to reality as familiar fingers caressed her hair, the other hand tracing patterns on her arm.
                “Do you want me to be honest?” I asked, wiping her tears, holding her hands. she nodded and moved her head but she wants to listen.
                “Well..” She began, putting her arms around me in a warm embrace. 
                “You are innocent. You are beautiful; unused. I think he liked that. All of the other girls he’d met had been screwed over already. But you were pure. Too pure for his dirty hands.”
                Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                She will teach me to do the right things,

                She will guide me through the right path,

                She will motivate me during my bad times,

                She will pray for me and for my future,

                She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

    The Boy and The Nails
                A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''


    story2=  '''
    Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                No scolding, no timeouts
                It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                Playing soccer with your head
                Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                Why don’t you hit me?
                Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

    Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

    story5= '''
    Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                Moral of the story:

                Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

    A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''

    One night a snake... while it was looking for food, entered a carpenter’s workshop.
                The carpenter, who was a rather untidy man, had left several of his tools lying on the floor.

                One of them was a saw. As it went around inside the shop, the snake climbed over the saw, which gave it a little cut.

                At once, thinking that the saw was attacking it, the snake turned around and bit it so hard that its mouth started to bleed, enraging the snake even more. The snake continued to attack the saw over and over again until the saw was covered with the snake’s blood. Sadly, the snake did not realize what was actually happening.

                Dying from its own wounds, the snake decided to wrap itself around the saw and began to squeeze with all its strength but alas! it ended up killing itself.

                Sometimes during certain life situations, we react with anger not realizing that we are only hurting ourselves. In life it's better to sometimes ignore situations, people and their behavior. People say and do things but it's our decision whether to react in a positive or in a negative way.

                The carpenter and his tools in this story are like those unpolished, insensitive people and their equally insensitive utterances that cut us in the heart, hurt our sentiments, and cause us emotional damage. But it is up to us to either ignore them and go our way without letting their words touch/harm us or to react foolishly like the snake in this story and end up in a miserable condition due to our short-temper.

                “Soft answers remove anger, Rough words raise rage.”
                I would also say to all foster mom or aunts to understand that they are hurting themselves in a long run'''

    The school bus would arrive at any moment. Parth hurried to a table to drink his milk. Just then Bhakti, Parth's younger sister arrived there. She took a plate for her breakfast. Her hand mistakenly touched the glass of milk and the milk spilled over Parth's uniform.
                The ripple effects of anger
                "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.
                He was praying all the way that his class teacher should be in a good mood and pardon his coming late. But no prayers of pardons seemed to work for D.K sir. Parth's punishment was to go out on the ground and run one mile. He felt very embarrassed. All the way while running, Parth was burning inside. He blamed Bhakti for his punishment and was waiting to return home and scold her.
                He was very tired and exhausted because of his anger. When he returned home, he saw that Bhakti was studying for her geography test. "Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu", Bhakti was memorizing the capitals of Indian states. Parth entered the room and heard Bhakti's voice.
                "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                The ripple effects of anger2
                His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

                My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter. I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter’s giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through...I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter's giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through her child’s merry eyes.
                We talked about the carefree laughter of childhood before we had bills to pay and so many responsibilities.
                I asked my daughter, "So what makes you laugh when you get older, and the children are grown, and you no longer have to leave cookies out for Santa?"
                "I don’t know, Mom, she said. That’s what I’m expecting you to show me."
                That’s the thing about children; when you think they are grown and you’ve set good examples for them, they remind you that they’re still watching.
                Our children grew up in a pastor's home with many different kinds of people coming and going in their lives in many different places. Teaching our children to have a sense of humor was just as important as teaching them to have a strong prayer life.
                One of my many favorite memories of laughing together as a pastor's family was when a precious older member of our church, who was almost blind with cataracts, would prepare meals and bring them to us. She didn't realize that she mixed all the food on one big serving plate.
                The fried fish was often on top of cottage cheese and pineapple with beans and slaw on top of that. The children wouldn't eat the food and didn't know what to say when she asked them at church how their dinner was.
                A pastor friend suggested we name our garbage can "Spot." So when the sweet lady asked the kids how the food was, they would say, "It hit the spot!" Laughter always made our lives fun and helped us get through stressful times.
                We need laughter in the good times and the bad. Laughter makes us feel good, releases pressure in a bad situation, gives us energy, and makes the most miserable situation bearable at times. In general, it gives us a sense of well-being and a sense of community.
                Doctor Madan Kataria, author of the book, Laughter Yoga, said, "Children can laugh up to 400 times a day, but for adults, this frequency drops to barely 15 times a day."
                It may even be less this year with all the stress our country and families have been through.
                In 1995 Dr. Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai, India, experimented with humor’s therapeutic benefits by approaching strangers in a park in Mumbai. He then invented a series of breathing and relaxation exercises that stimulate merriment for better health called Laughter Yoga.
                Since then, thousands of social laughter clubs have been launched in 65 countries, including the United States.
                Some physicians prescribe laughter classes to the sick, elderly, young, and healthy for its stress-reducing effects. It is proven that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter.
                The physical benefits of laughter include reducing stress hormones, strengthening our immune system, cardiac conditioning, lower blood pressure, {especially in women), and it cleanses the lungs, which can aid in respiratory problems.
                Good reason to add laughter to our lives daily, right?
                When I added up the amount of laughter in my life, I found that most of the people I spend time with are people who like to laugh.
                As inspiration, I look no further than my own friends and family. My neighbor and friend is one particular person who inspires me. She is engaged, curious, strong, beautiful, and fun at age 89 ? exactly the kind of woman I'd love to be when I'm her age, should I have the good fortune to live that long in fine health.
                Listening to her share funny stories of stressful times in her life growing up during the great depression reminds me that there is a funny side to every situation. Spending any time with her reinforces the idea that we need a sense of humor to make it through the tough times in life and gives me new energy and hope for the future.
                My sisters, who were all more than ten years older than me, inspired me the same way. They knew how to use laughter as a healing agent. When we got together, we talk about our life as children. There were sad and painful times for us, but we always managed to turn our shared stories and thoughts into laugher that brought tears to our eyes.
                During the Covid-19 quarantine, I had an amazing friend who sent me videos of funny things and attitudes to cope with the quarantine. She says we need more comedy in our lives, and she is right. The videos were respectfully humorous, and they helped me laugh at myself.
                Laughter doesn’t mean you can’t be serious or that you are insensitive to the bad things happening in the world around us.
                However, it can be the difference between a life of black-and-white and a life filled with color. Laughter may not add years to your life, but it will add life to your years! It’s like a flower that blooms when it stretches towards the sun.
                A wise person realizes eating right and exercise is the best way to stay healthy, and it is a wise person who learns the importance of laughter in their lives.
                If we need a prescription for laughter, it can be found in a book that has been around a long, long time. A Bible verse in Proverbs reminds us that joy is an important part of a healthy life. "A merry heart is good like a medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength." (17:22, NLT)
                Laughing with our grandchildren is the most fun, and we do it a lot. Sometimes when our grandchildren get into trouble, we laugh and remind our children they did the same things when they were that age. But, for some reason, they don't always think that's funny.
                However, being a role model for our adult children has meant demonstrating how to live well and happy in good times and bad. Teaching them always to have a sense of humor and a strong prayer life will be their guide to setting the same example for their children."""

                Many frogs lived in the Champakan pond. Kanduk was a jovial frog. He loved to make other frogs laugh. One day, while Kanduk was entertaining his friends in the pond, King Sher Singh came there to have a bath. Unfortunately, the king stepped on one of Kanduk’s legs and it broke. Kanduk screamed in pain. The king immediately admitted him to the hospital for treatment.
                The Minister of Laughs
                Doctor Bhola, the bear had to replace Kanduk’s leg with a wooden leg. Kanduk practised using his artificial leg and soon got used to it. Now wherever he went, he would praise his wooden leg a lot. Once Kanduk’s friend Champa, the squirrel was unwell. She was down with typhoid and was admitted to the hospital. When Kanduk heard about it, he went to visit her along with his brother Tandul.
                The hospital was crowded with patients and visitors. Kanduk decided to entertain all the patients and began narrating the story about his wooden leg. He said, “Having a wooden leg has its benefits. It cannot get injured and so does not pain!”  Then he called a patient and gave him a stick. “Hit and see.” That patient, Uluk hit Kanduk’s leg with all his might. Kanduk started laughing. He said, “See, I didn’t get hurt.” Everybody smiled looking at Kanduk. After visiting Champa, Kanduk and Tandul returned home. Kanduk began stroking his leg. Seeing this, Tandul asked, “What happened?”  “Uluk hit me on my real leg by mistake. If I wouldn’t have laughed, how would I have brought smiles on so many faces? It was a small price to pay to make others laugh.” said Kanduk and laughed out loud. Tandul was amazed and said “You are great! Kanduk. You can laugh despite the pain. Laughter is the best Medicine.”

            story3="""Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as “terminally ill”. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500.
                He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, “If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?”
                He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find – Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something funny.
                His pain was so great he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
                He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy, healthy and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
                Some people think laughter is a waste of time. It is a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to indulge in only every so often.
                Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we’re not well, laughter helps us get well; if we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
                Since Cousins’ ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind and the emotions.
                So, if you like laughter, consider it sound medical advice to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don’t like laughter, then take your medicine – laugh anyway.
                Use whatever makes you laugh – movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, New Yorker cartoons, jokes, friends.
                Give yourself permission to laugh – long and loud and out loud – whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you’re strange, but sooner or later they’ll join in even if they don’t know what you’re laughing about.
                Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure. . . laughter.

                “Oh. Hello.” She tried to sound normal. She didn’t feel normal. She felt like she was teetering on the edge of something. That feeling where you’re not sure if it’s laughter or tears — both hysterical — that will come out of your body.
                “I’m lichen it.” His voice was deep, laconic. Australian.
                “What?” Her brow furrowed. The green mask hid her mouth.
                “I’m lichen it.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. The weird feeling was still there. Tears? Laughter? She wasn’t sure, but when it came, she knew she’d have no control. None.
                You see, she’d been locked inside her two-roomed ‘palace’ for 21 days. The whole weird world lockdown had triggered her already fragile self into going into herself, into self-isolation. For longer than 14 days because…well…you never can tell. I mean, perhaps she had touched a metal hand-rail when she took the train, or when she’d walked into the toilets at the cinema. There were germs everywhere. And now they had a name.
                “Barry.” She looked at him, fully into his face, her mouth a little slack with surprise. Her eyes, wide.
                “What?” She wondered if he some kind of telepathy.
                “My name. Barry. And I’m lichen it!” He grinned at her. The lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. And his eyes twinkled. The smile was cheeky. He had no mask. Brave. His brown hair flopped onto his forehead. He had a black t-shirt on, AC/DC on the front.
                She must have looked a little puzzled. Although he could only see her eyes, they must have shown her confusion. He started to laugh. It was a deep laugh. Straight from his belly. It was lovely!
                “The bench! We’re sitting on…” he gesticulated. His hands were broad and capable. Clean too. Fingernails, neat. Blonde hairs on the backs of his hand glistened in the sun.
                It was then she noticed. She who notices everything. Every hair follicle. Every leaf on every tree. Every blade of grass. Every freckle dusting Barry’s arm.
                The bench was covered in lichen!
                She felt it. Not the lichen but the laughter. Bubbling up, like a soda bottle, shaken not stirred. It bubbled up and up and out of her! Such laughter, a beautiful sound! A beautiful feeling! The lichen!
                “I’m lichen it!” he grinned at her again, obviously glad she had reacted.
                She pulled at the mask hiding her mouth, gulping the air as the laughter came, flowing like a stream.
                How could she be laughing? With a stranger? On a park bench? At this time in the world’s history?
                But it wouldn’t be stopped. It flowed! Her every nerve, cell, neuron, given life by laughter, glowed in the sunlight. She put the mask down next to her.
                “So, you’re a lichen expert then,” she chortled, leaning over with the laughter pouring out of her. He began to laugh too.
                “I know what I’m lichen,” he replied, “And I’m lichen you!” His whole face contorted as his laughter burst out of him! He slapped his thigh, leaning backward and forwards as the hilarity took control of him.
                She tried to reply, feeling the peeling lichen under her hands. Laughter had taken control of her. All her fears disappeared in wave after wave of glorious giggles.
                She stood up, held her hand out to him.
                “Come on, Barry! I’m lichen you too! Let’s make like a tree and leave!” She let out a huge gust of laughter. Barry grabbed her hand and stood up, laughing his wonderful belly laugh.
                They wandered off. Who knows where? Nothing was open so perhaps they went back to her place. She left the mask behind.

They pretend to show the fabric, and the emperor is forced to act as if he sees the fabric lest he is called a fool and dishonest. The emperor hires the two conmen to make special robes for him.
                They keep pretending to weave clothes, and everybody in the king’s court is forced to act as if they are seeing the beautiful dress being woven for the emperor. One fine day, the conmen announce that the robe is ready, and ask the emperor to wear it for the upcoming procession.
                Though the emperor couldn’t see the robe, he obliges. He pretends to wear the robe and goes on the procession naked. No one wants to be called foolish or dishonest; hence, all the people remain silent about the emperor being naked. However, a child, innocent that he is, could not contain himself and blurts out, “The emperor is actually naked.” Then another child starts laughing, and the laughter spreads across.
                The emperor is baffled but having no choice he continues to walk the procession.
                He decides to punish the conmen, but they are already gone with the hefty money that they got as remuneration for the clothes that they never weaved.

            story11="""he doorbell rang in the late afternoon. A bearded man, dressed in a dark blazer and pants, handed Mom a large garbage bag. “Your mister ordered these,” he said, then turned and left.
                Mom dragged the sack into the kitchen of our home in suburban Sherwood Park, Alta. My 10-year-old brother came into the room: “What’s in there? It’s moving.”
                I gave a piercing, seven-year-old-girl shriek. Something in the lumpy bag was struggling to escape. Mom spun around. “Oh, shi—shoot. Take it to the garage.”
                My brother hauled the bag away. In the garage, Mom grabbed the axe from its spot on the wall. Dark-jacketed men, mysterious packages and now axes, I thought. It was turning out to be an interesting day.
                Mom approached the bag like a bomb-squad member, opened the top and retreated a few feet. There was a rustle and then a chicken with a partially detached head blasted out. Dad was a thrifty man, unable to resist the Hutterite’s price for unplucked, freshly killed (or, in this case, mostly killed) poultry.
                The chicken, delighted to be free of the cramped bag and its deceased kin, made several leaps around our garage, like a spasmodic ballerina. Mom’s former-farm-girl know-how abandoned her, and she looked a little sick. She handed my brother (whose closest experience with a live chicken was an undercooked nugget) the axe. “Chop its head off,” she said.
                “Okay.” He took a half step forward, turned pale, then handed the axe back. “You chop it off.”
                The hen ran in enthusiastic circles, letting out garbled squawks, more bothered by captivity than its neck problem. It darted toward us, wings flapping, feathers shedding. We all screamed and tried to hide behind one another. The bird darted away, terrified. Mom admitted defeat, herded us inside and called my father. Until he arrived, she eyed the door as though the chicken might grab the axe itself and hack its way through.
                Hours later, I snuck out to the garage. No more chicken, and the axe was back on the wall. When I asked Dad what happened to the animal, he told me it had run away.
                For months I watched in vain for a droopy-headed chicken lurking in the neighbourhood. To my dad’s credit, no more dark-suited men carrying bags ever arrived at our door again. And, many years later, my brother, still horrified, exclaims, “Mom handed me the axe.”

                        Some background, my parents are immigrants from South Korea. They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.


                        That is how generous my mother is. She gives all she has to us, and more.

Then he saw another bigger one, but again he thought that maybe there is an even bigger one waiting for him.
                        Later, when he finished more than half of the wheat field, he started to realize that the wheat is not as big as the ones he let go off, he started to realize that he had missed the best one in the search of a bigger.  So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.  This is the mistake often made by people who fell in love and lost the best person they could have in their life”.

But, once you truly fall in love, you must never let go of that person due to your anger, ego or comparisons with others”.
                        “How do they end up marrying someone other than they loved?” the student asked.  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the corn field and choose the biggest corn and come back. But the rule is same as before, you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the corn field, this time he was careful to not to repeat the previous mistake.  When he reached to the middle of the field, he picked one medium corn that he felt satisfied with and went back to the teacher.  He described how he made a choice.  The teacher told him, “This time you didn’t came empty handed.  You looked for one that is just nice, and you had put your faith that this is the best one you can get.  This is how one makes a choice for marriage.”

Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me.

                        I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                        I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                        It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                        I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                        I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                        That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                        As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                        She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                        I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                        As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                        People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                        Why, out of all the girls he had, did he have to choose to hurt me?” The girl cried, showed the bruises which she did because of him.She came back to reality as familiar fingers caressed her hair, the other hand tracing patterns on her arm.
                        “Do you want me to be honest?” I asked, wiping her tears, holding her hands. she nodded and moved her head but she wants to listen.
                        “Well..” She began, putting her arms around me in a warm embrace. 
                        “You are innocent. You are beautiful; unused. I think he liked that. All of the other girls he’d met had been screwed over already. But you were pure. Too pure for his dirty hands.”
                        Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                        “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                        She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                        “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                        That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                        Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                        Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                        Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                        I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                        My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                        Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                        “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                        How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                        I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                        And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                        She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                        She will teach me to do the right things,

                        She will guide me through the right path,

                        She will motivate me during my bad times,

                        She will pray for me and for my future,

                        She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                        And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                        Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                        I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                        She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

                I just never knew you would turn out to be so much harmful; else, never I must have bothered to you. A friend would never do something like what you did. I indeed feel unenviable to recollect the fact that we were friends.

                I remember when I first met you. It was quite a sunny day, and our first day at college. Students of the new batch were to assemble in the main hall. It was the first time when I caught a glimpse of you. You were in your red shorts and a plain black t-shirt, with a ponytail and you looked very fine. Some boys even wanted to talk to you. I purposely stood next to you. I genuinely thought you might be a generous girl with a firm attitude. Our college principal began his speech to his New Year students and we stood straight.


                
                Suddenly a choking voice of the microphone came out of the speakers in a very harsh voice, some of the students started laughing about it, and you were one of them. You shouted and howled like a guy, and it was outrageous to see a girl doing such stuff. You suddenly turned to me and laughed, expecting that I too must laugh on this, but I just smiled at you gladly. I was very happy to get your attention, but your behavior wasn’t comforting. I desperately needed a friend in the new college, new town and most importantly a new life after school.

                We were to move back to the mess for the food. I again purposely sat next to you, hoping to have a conversation. You took my presence and began talking to me. Really, you were too amiable to me. You did not let me feel that was our first conversation, especially the way you hit me on my back repeatedly, just as if how usually boys do! I learnt you love sports, and basketball was your game. Well, it was too obvious to know, you were a tomb boy. But whatever you were, I was happy to have a good-looking sport-loving girl as my friend. We exchanged our numbers and came in contact. You lived in the college residence but I lived with my relatives in the town.


                
                Then we kept on meeting very often. Gradually, we went on being good friends. Nevertheless, you made me feel deplorable sometimes the way you dealt with others. You often cracked jokes on others, badgered and annoyed our classmates with your irritating tricks and abused girly girls for the way they dressed themselves. Sometimes, you did not spare even me with your endurable spirit of teasing. People asked me huge times to remain away from you. They all had come to know we didn’t share any single quality and that I was just being nice to you. Unfortunately, their perception was true. Many a times I felt like I should quit your friendship, but one thought always stopped me to proceed, as you were the only friend of mine, who was so popular, handsome and undeniably, my first friend in the college. But it was becoming too harder to remain friends with you.

                After a lot of patience, I decided to get separated from your friendship. I started ignoring you a bit, like if you appeared in my sight, I pretended as if I have not seen you. But I guess you caught me. You soon understood my ignorance. You came to me and directly asked me if there was anything wrong. This one single thing was only appreciating, that you were always straight in your talks. You never tangled the confusions or talked indirectly, which I definitely lacked. I then settled things by providing lame explanations. Somehow you accepted and never bothered about my ignorance as you were too much busy with your sports.


                
                Our first year came near to end. You won us the inter college basketball championship, as the captain. Principal and every one appreciated for your efforts. Really, we all were proud of you. Unluckily our exams were just one month after. You did not study the entire year and were always engaged in your basketball shots and strategies. You were horrified to see such lny syllabus and were all confused. You asked me to help you in studies. I agreed. However, I just did not know you thought me a fool. You wanted me to complete all your assignments and projects. I somehow did. You wanted me to teach you like a tutor, fill your mind with everything given in our textbooks. I agreed to explain you though, but you were not satisfied with whatever I taught you. You treated me very gratingly as if I owed a lot to you. I did every possible thing for you to get ready for exams, but still you were not gratified. You wanted more out of me; you wanted me to give more and more time to you. But I had to study for my exams too.I tried to tell you indirectly that I can’t do anything more than this, but I guess you did not want to understand my problems.


                
                I was extremely chafed by your behavior. I then decided to completely dismiss, no matter what. I began ignoring your calls and messages. I switched off my cell phone. You were annoyed by this attitude of mine and got impatient. You visited me at my place un-announced, and burst in anger. You capper clawed, yelled and abused me as if I did a crime by not giving attention to you. As soon as you left, I uttered a great cry and kept on weeping that whole night.

                We were not friends anymore. I decided never to talk to you, so did you. After that day, we often saw each other; but we turned our heads in other directions each time. Nevertheless, I’m just not hesitant to tell you, that now I actually love life without you. Moreover, I need you to know, that Friend, you are not tolerable!

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...

                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                Once upon a time there was a zombie called Patizombi, who was fed up with being the villain in everyone’s stories. So, to prove that he could do good, he decided to go hunting evil ghosts.

                But ghosts aren’t very visible and they’re sneaky too. It was only after many failed attempts that Patizombi spotted a confused ghost floating through the forest. He approached it carefully, set out his traps and jumped on him.

                The battle was going very badly until Patizombi realized that he was in fact not fighting a ghost but a clingy bedsheet he’d been trapped by.

                “Ha, ha, ha! You have fallen right into my trap, you evil zombie!” A ghost laughed, emerging from his hiding spot.

                “Ahh, evil ghost,” Patizombi replied. “I’ll catch you one day.”

                “No, no, no, no and no!” said the ghost, incredibly offended. “Excuse me, but I am a good ghost and my job is to hunt evil zombies.

                “Oh no you don’t!” objected Patizombi, “because I am a good zombie, and I am the one who hunts evil ghosts.”

                After arguing for a little while, they realised they were both telling the truth. They found it funny and became friends.

                “I suppose not all ghosts are evil…”

                “Nor all zombies…”

                “We could join forces to hunt ogres”

                And they headed as a team into the mountains, where the most fearsome ogres were hidden. Working quickly together, they found the track of an ogre that led them to a cave. As the ogre was out, they prepared a trap but while they were doing so a giant stone fell and blocked the entrance leaving them trapped.

                “Ha, ha, ha! it was so easy to trap that evil zombie and his ghostie partner!”

                “Lies!” they protested from inside, “We are not evil. The only evil one is you and we have come to catch you!”

                Once again, the discussion carried on until everyone was persuaded that none of them was evil.

                “We would never have thought that good ogres existed”

                “Neither would I have thought that a zombie and a ghost were not evil”

                It is obvious that, before you set out to hunt anyone, you need to make sure that they are evil...

                That is how they discovered that, even if a creature has a reputation for being evil, it is not always true. And this is also true for all other creatures who have a reputation for being dirty, noisy or annoying: you can never tell which ones are actually like that without first getting to know them. That is how they found many more zombies, ghosts and good ogres who joined their group of catchers of evil creatures. Everyone trusted this valley police force, which never allowed anyone to be treated badly due to prejudice and to bad reputations they did not deserve.

Get out of here, weirdo!"

                Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful. But then she remembered what her mother had always told her: "My dear, you are what you are, warts and all; and never doubt that you are this way for a very special reason..."

                But then, one day, the witches of the neighbouring land invaded and destroyed the country, putting all the fairies and wizards in prison. Our fairy, just before being attacked, put a spell on her own clothes and, helped by her ugly face, she managed to pass for a witch. That way she was able to follow the witches back to their den.

                Once there she used her magic to prepare a big party for everyone, decorating the cave with bats, toads and spiders. The music was provided by a pack of howling wolves. While the party was in full swing, the fairy hurried off and set free all the fairies and wizards who had been imprisoned. When all of them were free, they worked together on one big spell which succeeded in trapping the witches inside the mountain for the next hundred years. And for the next hundred years, and more, everyone remembered the great bravery and intelligence of the ugly fairy.

                And from that day on no one in that land ever saw ugliness as a disgrace. Whenever someone ugly was born, people were filled with joy, knowing that for that new person great things lay ahead.

                Mr. Horsefly was the new head of the prairie post office. He had put a lot of time and effort into getting this highly respected position; he had even moved fields. If you asked Mr. Horsefly, he would tell you that he got the job thanks to his great deductive gifts.

                On his first day at work, he opened up shop, and into the post office came Mr. Beetle, Mrs Spider, Miss Mantis, and Mr. Grasshopper.
                Mr. Horsefly wouldn't let them so much as open their mouths.

                "Don't tell me, don't tell me. I bet I can work out what each of you came for," he said, putting a book, a plastic mat, a nail file, and some protective goggles on the counter.

                "The nail file will be for Mrs. Spider, without a doubt. With all the scratching she does, she'll need to put her nails right. “The mat”, he went on, without giving anyone time to react, "without even having to think about it, I give it to Mr. Grasshopper, since he must have to train pretty hard to keep all his hopping about up to a decent standard. The safety goggles have to be for Mr. Beetle, because having to spend all day with his face so close to the ground, he'll be needing something to protect his eyes. And finally, this big book here, has to be a Bible. I'll have to give that to Miss Praying Mantis, whom I would like to ask to include me in her supplications to The Almighty. As you will see..."

                They didn't let him finish. The comment about the mantis - well known on the prairie for having changed her name from Miss Praying Mantis to simply Miss Mantis - was just too much for everyone, and they burst out laughing...

                "Not much of a detective, are you!" said Mr. Grasshopper, between chuckles. "For a start, Mrs. Spider came for the book. She's very quiet, and doesn't scratch a soul. The mat is for Mr. Beetle, who likes to sunbathe in his swimming pool, and do it lying on his back. Miss Mantis will, of course, want the nail file. She's a bit of a flirt, you know. And the protective goggles are for me. I'm not as young as I was, and don't see to well. These days when I'm hopping on the grass I get the odd black eye..."

                “Uhu”, Mr. Horsefly interrupted, recovering a little from his embarrassment, "then you do, in fact, hop on grass!"

                "Yes, I do," answered the grasshopper, "but as you'll see, making your deductions based simply on prejudice, leads to more misses than hits..."

                How right he was! Just a few days later, after having met all the insects in person, Mr. Horsefly had a good laugh while telling this story about his deductions made from prejudice without yet having met a soul. And he understood that judging without knowing is a practice for fools.

                XT-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read "XT-27: The best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other XT-27s.

                "All robots should be like us XT-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the XT-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

                One day, he was walking along in Bionic City, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors (that's eyes to you and me, but XT-27 liked to use highly technical sounding words for everything).

                He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an XT-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were XT-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing!

                Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XT-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble (a house), on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were XT-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more.
                On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time.

                So XT-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another XT-27.
                So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push...
                When he woke up, the XT-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The XT-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The XT-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "XT-28, the best, most modern robot".
                So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The XT-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn't feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points.

                There was once a boy who was afraid of the dark. He thought that when it was dark his bedroom filled up with monsters. But there came a time when he was too old to be allowed to keep sleeping with the light on.

                That first night he was paralysed with fear, his mind full of monsters. So much so, that he went over to his wardrobe to get a torch. But when he opened the wardrobe door he came face to face with a monster, and he let out the loudest scream in the world.

                The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and... started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there.

                The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair.

                The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons... It was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends.

                And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.

                Once upon a time, there was a gang of evil goblins who lived in a forest. They spent a lot of their time making fun of a poor old man who could now hardly move, see, or hear. They showed no respect for his age.

                The situation became so extreme that the Great Wizard decided to teach the goblins a lesson. He cast a spell, and from that moment, every insult they directed at the old man made the old man better, but had the opposite effect on the goblin who was doing the insulting. Of course, the goblins knew nothing about what was happening. The more they called the man an "old fool", the younger and sharper of mind he became, while the goblin who had shouted at him aged rapidly, and became a little more foolish.

                As time went on, those evil goblins were becoming terribly old, ugly, stupid, and clumsy... without even realising it. Finally, the Great Wizard allowed the goblins to see themselves, and, terrified, they saw that they had turned into the disgusting creatures we now know as trolls.

                Reggie couldn't hear a thing. He was a normal boy, but he had been born deaf. He was well known to everyone in town, and they were all very fond of him. Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby.

                Reggie didn't like this very much. But the person who disliked it the most was his friend Michael, who decided one day that things had to change. Michael's father was the town´s Mayor, and Michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of Reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs.

                People liked the idea, because everyone loved Reggie. The day became known as The Day of Silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: Reggie was amazing!

                On that day no one was thinking of Reggie as just a deaf person. This meant he could be treated just like any other little boy; and people saw a whole new side of him. Not only that, but Reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, Reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all Reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference.

                So the Day of Silence was the day Reggie´s true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head. A helmet with great thick ear flaps; a helmet which meant you couldn't hear the slightest thing.

                Pete Sparks was a sensitive boy. So sensitive that even his hair was ticklish. You only had to touch his hair a little bit and he would burst out laughing. And when this ticklish laughter started, no one could make him stop.

                So Pete grew up used to strange situations. When his granny’s friends came to visit, he would always end up in stitches because there was never any shortage of little old ladies rubbing his head and saying “How cute!”

                Windy days were the worst, with Pete on the ground, paralyzed by laughter whenever the breeze blew on his locks, which, incidentally, were pretty long because at the barber shop no one could manage to cut his hair, due to the non-stop giggling. To see Pete laugh, as well as being great fun, was terribly contagious. When Pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing.

                As Pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places. Some activities are serious business, and cannot be done amid gales of laughter. So Pete tried everything to control his ticklishness: he tried wearing a thousand different hats, he used ultra strong hairsprays and gels, he shaved his head, and he even went on a yoga course to see if he could bear the tickling by learning to relax himself.

                But nothing worked; it was impossible. He wanted, with all his heart, to just be a normal boy. So, as time went on, he began to feel sad and ill-fated for being different.
                This went on until, one day in the street, he met a special clown. The clown was very old and could hardly walk, but when he saw Pete in tears, he went to cheer him up. It didn’t take long to make Pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown.

                “I have no one to replace me”, said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do”. Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought “serious? A clown?”, trying to understand what the old man had told him.

                “Come, I’ll show you” said the clown.

                So the clown took Pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show Pete’s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter.

                When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at Pete and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age”.

                “It’s true,” answered Pete, smiling and returning the wink, “not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. And that’s so hard to find”. This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter.

                And that is how Pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that Pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days. While they were traveling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.

                The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha, The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.

                After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.

                Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.

                What did Buddha emphasize here? He said, It is effortless. Having 'peace of mind' is not a strenuous job; it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment, such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.

                But when the King looked, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in the midst of the rush of angry water, sat the mother bird on her nest ... perfect peace.

                Which picture do you think won the prize?

                The King chose the second picture.

                Do you know why?

                "Because," explained the King, "peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard work. Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart. That is the real meaning of peace."

            story5="""One day the most peaceful inhabitants from the Earth asked one very powerful wizard to stop all wars and bloodshed on the planet.

                – It is simple, – he said. — I will destroy all weapons on the Earth, and nobody will be able to fight anymore.

                – It would be great! –people exclaimed.

                The magic wand’s wave – and this was done.

                There was a peace on the planet for three days, while the majority of those who were prone to fight, sought and could not find a weapon. When they understood they’ve lost it forever, they have made spears of young trees and started to fight again.

                When the wizard heard this bad news, he said:

                – Do not worry. I will destroy all young trees, so that they will not be able to fight.

                After two or three days of useless search for young trees, suitable for making spears, rebellious people started to cut giant trees, make batons from them, and the bloodshed has started again. The Wizard destroyed all big trees. Then humans made knives and swords of metal. He destroyed all metal on the planet. People made sling and began to throw stones at each other. It was necessary to destroy the stones, too. And then peacekeepers began to worry: all trees have disappeared; there is no metal and stones. How to live, what to eat now? There will be no vegetation soon, and people will die without even fighting. No, this is a wrong solution of the problem.

                The Wizard became confused:

                – I do not know how to behave now. I would have destroyed all humanity, but, unfortunately, it is not in my power!

                The peacekeepers fell into despair; they did not know what to do. And then one clever kid turned to the Wizard.

                – I know what you should do. Let people feel, how others perceive their actions. If one person hurt someone, let him feel the same pain, and if he brings joy to someone, let him feel the same joy. So no one will hurt each other, because he will feel the pain immediately too and would have to stop.

                All people were inspired with the greatness of kid’s thought, and the wizard realized his idea. He returned all trees, stones and metals.

                Since that day nobody on the planet tried to hurt his neighbour, because he would have to feel the same pain too. People began to help each other, because they liked the sense of joy they felt at this moment. And they began to live in harmony and joy.

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...
                
                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                A heart touching STORY - PEACE!! :)

                A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block.
                He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did U take all this time to come? Don’t U know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t U have any sense of responsibility?”
                Th…e doctor smiled & said:”I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call…… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work”
                “Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would U calm down? If your own son dies now what will U do??” said the father angrily.
                The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”
                “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.
                The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,“Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If U have any question, ask the nurse!!”
                “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
                The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”
                The patient father remained speechless.

                There was a monk who lived on the edge of a small town, much to the delight of the townspeople. Whenever he ventured into town to help someone, everyone came out of their homes to give him gifts from their gardens, calling out to him, "Oh, Teacher, we're so fortunate to have you living nearby! You are such a wonderful person! You do so much good, Teacher! Your presence is such a blessing!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                One day a young woman came to the monk's hut and said, "Oh, Teacher, I'm in terrible trouble. I'm pregnant and my family will disown me. The young man who I love so much has fled to another town because my family would certainly do him harm. I have nowhere else to turn and no one else to ask for help."

                The monk replied that she could live in the back room and help around the house and she would then have the security of a home for her child.

                Well, now when the monk went into town, he was reviled. "You dirty old man! Look how you have betrayed our trust and taken advantage of that young woman! How could we have ever believed in you? What shame you have brought on us!" And they hurled rotten fruit at him along with their insults.

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                After a while, the father of the child returned to the town and presented himself before the family, saying, "I have spent the past two years learning a trade in a neighboring town and now I am able to provide a home for your daughter and grandchild." The family was overjoyed. Although it wasn't the best of situations, it was so much better than they had feared that they welcomed their daughter and grandchild back into the family with open arms.

                How different it was when the monk came into town then. The townspeople lined the road every time, presenting him with gifts of food and calling out, "Oh, Teacher, how could we have ever doubted you? Look at the wonderful thing you have done! We are so ashamed! Please forgive us! You are such a wise and compassionate person! We are so fortunate to have you living nearby!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                While there is no single interpretation that would do justice to this story, it certainly speaks to the equanimity of the monk. Against the backdrop of praise and condemnation, he holds himself apart from "what everyone thinks" even as he acts with the most compassionate and involved sense of responsibility. Whether in public or the workplace or in the privacy of home life, people will misread our intentions and jump to conclusions that cast us in a bad light. The most straight-forward lesson of this story, then, is that by continuing on the most ethical course of action our true intents become known. This, however, can be a short-lived vindication as the same thing may happen all over again: We ought not be pulled off-center by shallow praise any more than by shallow criticism.

                The monk in this story serves as a model by maintaining emotional detachment from the transient opinions of others while never withdrawing from personal involvement with others' real needs

                A woman whose husband died unexpectedly faced dire circumstances. Creditors hounded her, taking everything away from her and her young son. Fearing she might lose the most valuable possession of the family, she hid the priceless jewel that had been handed down for generations by sowing it into the sleeve of an old coat that the creditors would never want. The troubles weighed on her grief and eventually broke her spirit and she died without ever telling her son about the jewel.

                The boy found himself without family or home, his only inheritance the old threadbare coat that the creditors left him. He found work wherever he could, staying in barns or out in the forest, exposed to the elements and grave hardship. Filled with sorrow at his fate, he endured the passing years with an abiding belief in the unfairness of life.

                One day, as he was chopping wood, his sleeve caught on a branch and tore open. Out spilled the priceless jewel onto the ground before him!

                The source of happiness -- real wealth -- is our birthright, something we carry with us from childhood whether we remember it or not. We are rich, the story says, even when we feel deprived. This is because, of course, the jewel represents the perfect nature of the true, original self with which we are born. Upon finding the jewel, the young man realized he had been rich all along -- and his life changed irreversibly in just that single moment of recognizing the jewel.

                Becoming more aware of the hidden jewel we carry at all times brings us in touch with the source of inner peace and happiness. The more we identify with our hidden treasure, the more we become a well of peace and happiness overflowing into the lives of others.

                A wandering monk passed by the courtyard of a monastery where he heard two groups of monks arguing about the temple flag fluttering in the breeze.

                "No, it is the wind that moves," argued the other group.

                Back and forth they argued, responding to the logic of the other side, coming up with new rationale for their respective positions. But it just came down to, "It is the wind that moves, it is the flag that moves."

                After listening for a while, the itinerant monk interrupted them and said, "If you look more closely you will see that it is neither the flag nor the wind that moves -- what moves is your mind."

                This story is a reminder of how easily we fall into "either-or" thinking. It doesn't matter what the subject is, we are fully capable of taking sides and then feeling the need to prove ourselves "right." The lesson of "seeing ourselves seeing" is a necessary one if we are to develop the witness awareness that watches habit thoughts and feelings arise automatically. Interrupting ingrained reactions to things allows us to consciously create new reactions that better reflect our current stage of development.

                n Ayodhya, there was a beautiful white pigeon. A very special kind. That beautiful white pigeon could fly high in the blue sky up from one tree to another tree, from one rooftop to another. Her wings made sounds like Phad... Phad… Phad... and she never seemed to mind because she had faith in her own capacities gifted by God… on her powerful wings!

                The pigeon lived in her nest made on Noore Allah Masjid, made with straws & threads collected from St. Mary’s Church near the Gurudwara.

                The pigeon flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir, and then she flew right back again. Birds have no religions, then why we humans?

                One sad day, when the pigeon flew out, it started to rain. Although she flew with all her might, she couldn’t get home again. She beat her wings against the rain, but they got wet and slowly some feathers drooped from her wings, and shewas injured due to this.

                The pigeon tried her best to fly. But she knew that she was “pooped.”

                A kind 7-year-old girl, Krishna, was watching that troubled pigeon. Krishna was enjoying a bath in the rain that time.

                Krishna saw the poor pigeon fall into her garden. Krishna felt that in that situation her duty was quite simple. She took that tiny frail bird and kept her warm and dry. She gave her water so she could drink, some food to eat and told her, “Not to cry... you will be o.k. soon Mashkalli!”

                Krishna named the pigeon “Mashkalli” because of Mashkalli’s beautiful white colour and eyes like diamonds. Krishna told Mashkalli, “You look like a “Shantidoot… Messenger of Peace & love!”

                Krishna cared for Mashkalli for fifteen days, until Mashkalli became quite strong. Krishna took Mashkalli everywhere she went, to school, to work, and to play. They grew very close during this period.

                One day Krishna watched Mashkalli fearfully. Krishna knew Mashkalli wouldn’t be there long.

                “Please, mummy, may I keep this bird Mashkalli? Now Mashkalli loves me and I love her. We are friends; I just can’t let him go.” Krishna’s voice was sad and low when she requested her mother.

                Krishna’s mother spoke softly and gently. She knew just what to say, “Look Krishna! Mashkalli’s home is somewhere else. Mashkalli’ must soon fly away... our garden has been a resting place for her, just like a small hotel or hospital. Krishna, it is nice of you that you took care of your bird friend Mashkalli. In her troubled time. However, this does not mean that you can keep her in any cage. If you really love someone, let us free them! If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly come back to you someday…!”

                Yes, what Krishna’s mother said was very true. It happened the next day. Mashkalli circled overhead, and then she flew away, as Krishna watched.

                Krishna felt a little sad for a few days because she was missing Mashkalli a lot. However, Krishna had full faith in her mother’s words. “If you really love someone you have to free them. If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly comeback to you someday…!”

                Now Mashkalli was rather home again. She was feeling very happy. Mashkalli again started to flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir.

                Now, “The Messenger of Peace & love: Shantidoot Mashkalli” takes a little longer flight. Mashkalli always stops at Krishna’s garden to tell her friend hello, pay thanks, and play with her every morning.

                If this, an uneducated bird can pay thanks to her helper, why not we, so called educated humans…?”

                In the rising sun’s light of hope, little Krishna was thinking this, and Shantidoot Mashkalli was eating food from Krishna’s little, soft palm, sitting on her hand. Krishna’s mother was watching that special friendship of an innocent human and an innocent bird. She smiled.

                A man woke up in the middle of a dirt road. Half of his face had brown dirt covering it, and his hair was a mess. His shirt was ragged, and he had lost a shoe. His vision was all blurry, and he was squinting in the sunlight, struggling to make use of his eyes. He could see a few hazy trees in the distance, beyond the expanse of dry, yellow land and grass. He had been in an accident. He had fallen from his buggy, banged his head, and had forgotten everything about himself. He had woken up with absolutely no memory of anything whatsoever. He knew he should have some memories, but he could locate none. He became very afraid. Who was he? How had he got here?

                As his vision continued to adjust to his surroundings, he saw a pile of papers on the ground, and a little red booklet resting on the top of them, just a few meters from where he was. He had not noticed, however, that a few meters to the left of this pile of information, was a lion.

                The lion walked gently in front of the papers, creating a barrier between them and the man. Then the lion sat down on his hindquarters, and looked at the man in the eyes.

                The man did not move. He was well aware that it was a lion now.

                "I saw what happened," said the lion, seeing that the man had no idea.

                "You were driving too fast in that thing," the lion nodded towards the buggy further down the dirt road, which was tipped over on its side. "And you fell out. These papers have all your information on them, your name, address – all of your details."

                The man felt like he was frozen to the warm earth beneath him.

                "Oh, and don't worry," added the lion, forgetting how things may have appeared to the man "...I'm not particularly hungry."

                "May I have the papers?" asked the man, wishing to get away with his details as quickly as possible.

                "Yes, of course," said the lion, standing up and ready to remove the blockade he had created.

                "Oh, thank you," said the man, relieved, "I don’t even remember who I am!"

                At this the lion stopped. He sat back down. This was too good to spoil. A man who had no ideas about himself? No psychological baggage at all? No identity to speak of? Oh, how wonderful...

                "Ah, amnesia of the self," said the lion, feeling refreshed. "Beautiful."

                "What do you mean beautiful?" asked the man impatiently, "I need my identity back! I mean...who am I? I know nothing of my past, not even my own name! Please!" he begged, "The papers!"

                "Listen to yourself panicking like this," the lion chuckled. "This is quite silly."

                "But I have absolutely no identity!" cried out the man, pleading for this lion to give him some information about himself.

                "I will give you these papers," said the lion, "but I want you to look at something. At the moment you know nothing about yourself, but you do not deny your own existence. You are begging me to give you your name and personal history, because without these stories you feel you are nothing, no one – that you don’t exist without your identity. But you are still here. Do not confuse your name, history and occupation with who you are. You exist, no matter what your story, what your name. If you were not so desperate for labels and definitions to create an identity for yourself, you would feel so free, so happy, so at one with this creation. Can you not just be comfortable having no definitions for a moment, and really be aware of what you truly are?

                "This is a blessing in disguise,” added the lion.

                This man felt he could not argue with the lion anymore, so he followed his orders. Who was he? This was what he was trying to find out through the information on those papers. But the lion was right, at the moment this man had no ideas about himself, yet somehow, his existence was being fully felt. His existence was present, but now it was no longer connected to any ideas. His existence was not limited to any particular form, it was everywhere, making up everything.

                The lion was now standing, looking at the man, with dark, deep eyes. As the man looked back at the lion, he felt like whatever was looking out of the lion's eyes, was not separate from what was looking out of his own.

                "Now you can have the papers." The lion pushed them with its paw towards the man, and they made a scraping noise on the ground. The man crouched down, picked them up, but now was not so eager to give himself a description. He figured these papers would be useful so he could find his house, get his bearings, but he didn’t need them to know who he was just yet. He placed them in his back pocket, and skipped off towards the hut he could now see in the distance, completely free of the ideas about himself he previously had.

                Morgan Stone, mother of five, had only seconds to spare to get her entire family out of their Indiana home before it was engulfed in flames last December.

                “It took me a second to really realize what was happening. When I opened the bedroom door and it was full of smoke, it took me a minute to grasp that this was a serious house fire,” Stone said.

                She sprang into action and got her five kids, her father-in-law and her pets out of the house before the whole structure burned.

                “He says I’m a hero,” Stone said of her fiancé, “But I don’t think I’m a hero, I’m just a mom who got my kids out safely—nothing means more to me than them.”

                The Triathlete Mom Who Saved a Drowning Couple
                Tamara Loiselle almost drowned six years ago, so she became a triathlete: “I resolved I was never going to be that weak and out of shape again,” she said.

                That resolve ended up being life-saving when she saw a couple drowning off the coast of Cancun last December. There was no lifeguard on duty, so Loiselle , a single mother of two, dove in herself, swam out and brought the couple safely to shore.

                “Words cannot describe my gratitude but I’ll try,” the man said in an interview. “You saved my girlfriend’s life and most certainly mine too.”

                There abode in Thessaly, in the days of Hercules, a strange race of men who had the head and arms of a man together with the body of a horse. They were called Centaurs, or Bull-Slayers.

                One of them named Cheiron, famous for his knowledge of medicine, music and botany, had been the teacher of Hercules. But many of them, although learned, were not good. Hercules and Theseus had waged war on them and had killed many, so that their numbers were greatly lessened.

                Having married Deianira, the daughter of a powerful King of Calydon, in Greece, Hercules was traveling home with her when he came to the banks of a river and was at a loss how to cross it. Seeing his perplexity, Nessus, one of the Centaurs, offered to take Deianira on his back and carry her over the stream. This offer Hercules gladly accepted.

                No sooner, however, did the crafty Centaur obtain possession of Deianira than he made off with her, intending to have her as his own wife. You can easily imagine how angry this outrage made Hercules. He shot one of his poisoned arrows with so much force that it went right through the traitor Centaur, and wounded him even unto death.

                But, before dying, Nessus had time to tell Deianira that if she wanted to keep Hercules always true to her she had but to take his shirt, and, when her husband's love was waning, prevail on him to wear it.

                Deianira took the shirt, and shortly afterwards, being afraid that her husband was ceasing to love her, she sent it to him as a present.

                Now, you will remember that Hercules had shot through the shirt of Nessus one of his poisoned arrows, and you will not be surprised to hear that some of the poison had remained in the shirt. So when Hercules put it on, which he did immediately upon receiving it, he was seized with frenzy and, in his madness, he uttered terrible cries and did dreadful deeds.

                With his powerful hands he broke off huge pieces of rock, tore up pine-trees by their roots and hurled them with resounding din into the valley.

                He could not take off the fatal shirt, and as he tore off portions of it he tore, at the same time, his quivering flesh.

                The servant of Deianira who had carried him the fatal shirt, and who wished to solace him in his pain, he seized as she approached him and flung headlong into the sea, where she was changed into a rock that long, so runs the legend, kept its human form.

                But at ln the majesty and the courage of the hero asserted themselves, and, although still in agony, his madness left him.

                Calling to his side his friend Philoctetes, he wished to embrace him once more before dying; but fearful lest he should, in so doing, infect his friend with the deadly poison that was consuming him, he cried in his agony: "Alas, I am not even permitted to embrace thee!"

                Then he gathered together the trees he had uprooted and made a huge funeral pyre, such as was used by the ancients in burning their dead. Climbing to the top of the heap, he spread out the skin of the Nemean lion, and, supporting himself upon his club, gave the signal for Philoctetes to kindle the fire that was to reduce him to ashes.

                In return for this service he gave Philoctetes a quiver full of those deadly arrows that had been dipped in the blood of the Hydra of Lerna.

                He further enjoined his friend to let no man know of his departure from life, to the intent that the fear of his approach might prevent fresh monsters and new robbers from ravaging the earth.

                Thus died Hercules, and after his death he was received as a god amongst the Immortals on Mount Olympus, where he married Hebe, Jove's cupbearer. In his honor mortals were commanded to build altars and to raise temples.

                The county recreation center swimming pool where one gets such badges presents very different conditions to those created when a June storm dumped six inches of rain over Columbia in Missouri with little warning—causing floodwaters from creeks to burst their banks, causing overflow zones to turn into ponds.

                When 15-year-old Dominic Viet and 16-year-old Joseph Diener passed a basketball court that had turned essentially into a water polo area, they heard the frantic shouting of a young woman desperately trying to keep her head above water under the force of a current.

                The boys had seen the girl swimming with a friend there before, but it was now obvious she was drowning.

                “The first thing that came into my mind was to get into the water,” Dominic told CNN. “We didn’t have time to think, her head was barely above the water and we could see her sinking more down every second. We didn’t think about the risks, we had to get her out.”

                Heroes will do as heroes do, and hoisting her up onto their shoulders, Dom and Joseph got her ashore, where emergency services arriving at someone else’s call performed first aid and rushed her to the hospital.

                Floodwaters are no conditions to be swimming in. There can be sewage runoff, loose chemicals, downed power lines charging the current with electricity, or physical debris such as manhole covers that have been lifted out of their sockets by the force of the water.

                Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Jenkins described the boys’ act as heroic and brave, as did Dominic’s mom, who had been calling her son for some time before and was growing nervous.

                She sent her husband, Dom’s father, to check on his position, but when he arrived he saw ambulances and firetrucks from the call that was meant to rescue the young woman.

                “I thought of the worst, he’s on a bike and people weren’t paying attention and my fear was he was going to pull up and see our son on the ground,” said Mrs. Viet. “But then he saw them on their bikes heading back to their friend’s house, and I got a text from Dominic saying ‘Coming home soon, just saved a woman’s life Mom.'”

                Oh Mom… how about you have a little faith?

                The fire department will honor the two boys with a “Citizen Life Safety Award” next week.

                Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant acted with bravery that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest honor.

                On Friday, Ralph Puckett, Jr. was hosted at the White House where he received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. government’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.

                Ralph’s first response was to ask, “Why all the fuss? Can’t they just mail it to me?”

                But, after his lifetime of service to the nation, President Joe Biden said at the medal ceremony, “Rather than mail it to you, I would’ve walked it to you.”

                Ralph’s wife of 68 years, Jeannie Puckett, was in the audience, too, as Biden described how the couple met—while the brave Army Ranger was recovering from his wounds.

                They were married two years to the day after the battle in November, 1950, for which he was honored this week with the following citation: “For acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the commander 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company…”

                51 of Puckett’s Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out in a daylight attack to take Hill 205, just 60 miles from the border with China, which drew mortar, machine gun, and small-arms fire against them. First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in their offensive.

                To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire.

                “Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position, with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” continued the citation.

                When the Rangers finally reached the top of the hill, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn’t nearly over.

                “During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett.”

                Even though Puckett’s Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one, five attacks by a battalion-strength enemy were repulsed.

                During the first wave, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support. Over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.

                “He repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole, to check the company’s perimeter and to distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers.”

                Extraordinary selflessness above and beyond the call
                When the enemy launched a sixth attack, two mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting “grievous wounds” in both his feet, his backside, his left arm and shoulder.

                “Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy.

                Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy-controlled hill.

                First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

                First Time a Foreign Leader Attended This Ceremony
                Biden said in his remarks, “Korea is sometimes called the “Forgotten War.” But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett’s command — they’ll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.”

                “And the people of the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the President of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before.”

                President Moon said, “I learned that I’m the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.

                “Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean War… Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea.”

                “From the ashes of the Korean War, we rose, we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea’s peace and freedom. And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.”

                Puckett’s military service did not end in the Korean War. He also served in the Vietnam War, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars, adding to his five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.

                Visionaries are often accused of being a little mad. Even by their wives. Such was the case of Laungi, a resident of India’s drought-blighted Gaya district in the eastern state of Bihar.

                Loungi Bhuiya had become increasingly distraught as more and more farmers—including four of his own sons—left Kolithwa for greener pastures. Taking a leaf from Don Quixote, Bhuiyan was determined not only to dream an impossible dream but to make that dream come true by single-handedly bringing water to his village in hopes of transforming the barren land into arable acreage.

                Inspired by the earlier exploits of “Mountain Man” Dashrath Manjh, who, with just a hammer and chisel, spent 22 years carving a road through the mountain near the village Gehlaur from 1960 to 1982, Bhuiya set out to dig an irrigation canal by hand to the closest water source in the Bangetha Hills.

                “I had heard about him and I thought if he can do it, why can’t I?” Bhuiya told Al Jazeera. “They all thought I was mad.”

                “He decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village,” Village leader Vishnupat Bhokta told the Tribune of India.

                “The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”

                Despite the teasing from his family and fellow villagers, the now 70-year-old Bhuiya toiled every day to make the four-foot-wide by three-foot-deep canal a reality. It took him nearly 30 years to accomplish his goal, but now everyone is benefitting from the fruits of his decades’ long labors.

                Bhuiya, whose reputation as a neighborhood eccentric has since been transformed into local hero, was recently rewarded for his efforts with a brand-new Mahindra tractor, which will be used to expand the canal.

                Of course, when Quixote creator Miguel de Cervantes wrote: “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical may be madness. To surrender dreams, this may be madness… Maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be,” he wasn’t referring to Bhuiya—but he just as well might have been.

After the game, as we were heading out, someone’s phone fell and smashed near us, and then a bunch of people started pointing up. There was a woman up there on the edge of the railing. I turned to Glenn and said, “Do you think she’s gonna jump?” He said, “Oh, boy, she’s falling as we speak."
                It’s about a four-story drop from where she fell, and — without thinking — I just put my arms out as she came toward me. Listen, I was in the Marines, and even though that was 40-some years ago, I still think like a Marine; fortunately, I still react like one once in a while. She leveled out flat as she hit my arms, and bounced off me and fell about four feet away. I fell to the ground, too, from the impact, and I blacked out for a minute. When I came to, Glenn was holding up fingers and saying, “How many do you see?” I was OK. The woman was alive but was in a coma for a while and had brain surgery. She later told me she was very grateful — they call her Miracle Girl. But what bothered me was that I didn’t do a better job of saving her. I couldn’t really latch on to her.

                It was 5 a.m. when I heard somebody screaming, “Help! It’s a bear!” I opened my front door, and there was a 275-pound polar bear sitting on its haunches with a woman in its mouth, waving her around like a rag doll. I thought to myself, I’ve got no weapon or anything. Then I saw my shovel sitting there and found myself going to get it. Once I picked it up, I thought, Well, am I going to do anything, or is that woman going to die? So down the steps I went. 
                When I got over there, I stepped up and hit the bear in the eye. I’d heard this is the best way to fight a bear. He let go of the woman, and she ran into my house. The bear reached out and grabbed ahold of me, and the mauling was on. He tore off my right ear, and I was waiting for him to bite me again. A neighbor fired a shotgun, but it didn’t do any good, so he jumped into his truck and gunned it toward us. I was on my belly on the ground, watching this vehicle speeding our way, and it stopped about two feet away before the bear let me go.

                I spent seven days in the hospital. They worked on me for four hours one day, to staple my wounds, and then for four hours the next day, putting my ear back on. So I came out of it pretty good.

                I never saw myself as a hero and still don’t. You’re dealt a situation, and you either respond or you don’t do anything. People say, “Would you have done anything differently?” I haven’t the faintest idea. The only thing I could think was, If I don’t do anything, she’s not going to make it.

                The crash woke me up. Just after midnight, on a very windy Sunday last October, I heard a very loud noise, and it was a large fir tree falling into my yard from the neighbor’s yard. It crushed a greenhouse and took down the tip of a power line as it landed. I’ve been in my house almost 50 years and know how much damage wind and trees can do, but as I was coming downstairs and glanced outside, I was horrified to see brilliant flames outside my window, way up over my head.

                I live alone­ — my husband died six years ago — and I thought, I have to call 911. But there was no time. I thought, This could go everywhere. It could burn the whole hill. I threw on something over my nightgown, raced outside, grabbed a hose and started spraying water as hard as I could. The wind had already spread the flames to a live oak and then to some blackberry vines on the edge of my driveway. It was really howling now, and I could feel the heat, but I just braced myself and kept on squirting.

                This must have gone on for five minutes, but it felt like an hour. An architect neighbor smelled smoke and ran over to help. Then the couple across the driveway came, and someone called the fire department. When the fire trucks arrived, they yelled at us to move back, but I couldn’t stop. I said, “We have to keep water on this fire.”

                I had no idea I had done anything special. People I never met were knocking on my front door the next day, saying, “You’re a hero. You saved the hill.” But I was just the first responder. I saw what I saw, and I took action.

                Thousands of people lost everything that night in other parts of California. We were fortunate to be spared. But I don’t think it was a miracle. The reality is, my children weren’t there and my husband wasn’t there, and if I wanted to stay in the home I loved, I would have to step up. So I did — but then got a lot of help.

I dressed myself and ran down the stairs in excitement. When I opened the front door to my surprise I found a big box in the middle of the door way. I jumped in joy and ran inside to see my aunties, uncles, brothers, cousins, grandparents and the rest of my family that were already awake.Everyone wanted me to open the box already but I waited till I put it on the table. Oh my goodness I was about to open it when I heard a noise coming from the box. IT WAS A KITTEN AND A PUPPY. I quickly opened it and found an adorable kitten who was all black with ginger and white patches on her. I named her Precious. Aw how cute was she. After that I carefully took my puppy out of the box and held him. He was a little tiny black and white dog with a few patches on him. I chose to name him terror because he tore the box open before I got him out. My family told me that I got my puppy Terror from my male relatives and I got the kitten Precious from my female relatives. The afternoon was here already and I had turned 15 at 12:13PM. My friends came over to celebrate my birthday. When they all got here to my surprise I had found a huge gift from all of them. I opened this card up and found airfares to Sydney and to go to Palm Beach to meet my inspirations, the cast of home and away.

                Life is full of unexpected surprises. There are many opportunities when one can secretly wish for something exciting to happen – something out of the ordinary. The real surprise is when the wish unexpectedly comes true. I never believed that something like this could ever happen to me; such a thing that would make me stop and look back at the events in awe. I think you would agree that something as simple as being lost in the forest for less than ten minutes should have no influence on my life. If you do agree, that makes both of us wrong.

                Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Coote’s Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

                As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. That’s when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that can’t be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

                I think that another reason that I felt carefree was because my parents didn’t panic. They took the situation under control and headed for any open area in hopes to find a map (many of these maps were found throughout the grounds, telling you where you were). From my point of view, at the time, it seemed as if they were excited as I was about losing our way. In the end, it only took my parents ten minutes to find such a map and we were back on the trail in no time.

                An experience like this made me think about my place in life. I’m the type who loves seeking out adventures. When we were lost, I realized that I had everything I would ever need with me – my family. They’ve always supported me in everything I do. This experience made me realize that families need to stick together; you don’t realize how much you need them until, for a moment, you think they’ll be the last people you see for the rest of your life.

                It’s incredible how much a simple thing like being lost in a forest for ten minutes will affect your outlook on life. Things like not being able to find your way back to where you came from make you appreciate the little things in life. Looking back on the day, I realize now that it was fate. Moments like that are few and far between and should be taken as a lesson. Surprises like this were, and always will be, an unexpected gift for all.

                I was full of excitement and very queer to see the new born baby next door. My Mom told that our neighbour, Shanti Bhabhi had given birth to a little fairy, the lakshmi of the home, a baby girl. But suddenly this happiness curve on my face disappeared with the thought of her husband. Shanti's husband, Raju bhaiya who was not a good man. A drunkard by nature, he had never provided that space to his wife and his male chauvinism was fiercely aggressive. I once heard his words in the street to the little daughter of our neighbours that studying and playing doesn't suit girls. They are meant for bangles and making rotis, just like a common male chauvinist. The prevailing awareness of the maltreatment of girls in the media, shook me again. I just wished that this liitle fairy should not face such a treatment and should be brought up on an equality basis with the sons of the same house. But somewhere in the heart the thought took place so firmly that I went to Shanti Bhabhi's house and what I saw next was unbelievable. I saw Raju Bhaiya with his little daughter in his hands and saying that he wished to grew his daughter with all the best education that he can afford. The love and incredibility of the moment rolled down tears from my eyes. I got back to my home relaxing that really the little fairy has brought happiness and a positive change along with a pleasant surprise.

                After a long bout with Parkinson’s, my Grandmother had passed. And as a pleasant surprise, I was in the will. I had inherited her car, and the ghost that came in the car. That’s right. Grandma’s car was haunted. Her 1980 Chevy Citation was haunted.

                I was surprised in so many ways. Hell, when I first turned the key I didn’t think that the thing would even start, let alone be haunted. It was an aged hunk of junk, and hadn’t seen much use in the past twenty years. And then when I saw the little figure creeping along the dash, I started to wonder if this was why she chose to stop driving it; and not because of the glaucoma.

                I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find something that wasn’t static, when it came. It was tiny, the size of my hand. It was the classic ghost. Literally, the classic ghost. In a little white sheet (a handkerchief, really) with tiny holes where the eyes and mouth would be. I couldn’t see any feet beneath the hem of the shroud, but it seemed to have tiny little hands poking up as it levitated towards me. And as it came drifting along, it was making a little ethereal ‘whooooooo’ sound at me.

                It was freaking adorable.

                I mean, come on. It was like a kindergarten Halloween decoration had come to life and came to visit. It was so little! It was smaller than the rat I had when I was in college. It was smaller than my breakfast sandwich. I wanted to pet it.

                I suppose in retrospect, yeah. I should have been a little more respectful. Maybe taken it a little bit more seriously. Seeing visible proof of the afterlife, actual confirmation of existence after death… well, that’s serious stuff. And, one would think, deserved more respect than the delirious giggles I wasn’t holding back.

                I think even the little ghost was actually taken aback by this. It stopped mid-‘whoo’ and kind of stared at me. It just drifted in place, bobbing like a floater in the corner of your eye.

                And there I sat, snickering and crouched back against the driver’s side door of the old Citation. The car still smelled like Vicks and old menthol cigarettes, the defining scents of my dear old Grandma.

                Was this Grandpa, maybe? Could it be? My mind raced. Grandma never spoke much of her ex-husband, just that he was a son of a bitch and that he had gotten his ‘just desserts’. Did his ‘just desserts’ involve being murdered and cursed to haunt a handkerchief on his jilted wife’s dashboard? But then I remembered mom saying that her dad had just jumped ship and moved to Iowa, where he had died in 1979.

                So my theory was obviously sunk. I peered at the little thing, static from the dusty old radio an idle buzz in the back of my mind. The ghost just bobbed in the warm air beneath the windshield, occasionally emitting little ‘Whooo’s!’ at me. I didn’t think it was trying to scare me anymore.

                Then a much more troubling idea occurred to me. What if this thing was my grandmother? Oh, now that’s a terrible thought. I couldn’t think of a worse fate than being doomed to spend the rest of eternity haunting the interior of a mid-80’s compact.

                And worse, if this was my Grandma’s spirit then I’d feel especially guilty taking the Citation to the junkyard to sell for parts.

                I had to know. I sat in thought for a moment, then came to a resolution. I was going to see exactly who — or what — this thing really was. I sat up in the drivers seat, steeled myself. I reached out towards the little ghost with my fingers trembling.

                I won’t lie to you, I was terrified. At first I thought the whole thing was kind of funny, this little cutesy ghost the size of half a donut. But the prospect of what could be under that little white sheet, that scared the hell out of me. I didn’t want to see my undead Grandma, pale and shrunken and horribly shriveled after death. I wanted Grandma to be in heaven with Great-Uncle Al, and all of her dogs, and her one cat that I had liked.

                As I slowly reached out my shaking hand, it actually reached out to me a little bit. I was startled, and snatched my hand back a little bit. But I focused, and mentally pushed my hand forward again. I had to know.

                I yanked up the little white sheet with my eyes shut tight, and after a second I slowly eased them open so that I could see who — what — it was.

                I didn’t know the guy.

                I ended up making four hundred bucks at the junkyard. Which was another pleasant surprise

                I had got the money by work done at home, out of office hours. It came to four pounds altogether. At first I thought I would use it to discharge a part of our debt to Eliza’s mother. But it was very possible that she would send it back again, in which case the pence spent on the postal orders would be wasted, and I am not a man that wastes pennies. Also, it was not absolutely certain that she would send it back. I sent her a long letter instead–my long letters are almost her only intellectual pleasure. As for the four pounds, I reserved two for myself, for any incidental expenses, and decided to give two to Eliza. I did not mean simply to hand them to her, but to get up something in the way of a pleasant surprise.

                I had tried something of the kind before. Eliza once asked me for six shillings for a new tea-tray that she had seen. I went and stood behind her chair, and said, “No, dear, I couldn’t think of it,” at the same time dropping the six shillings down the back of her neck. Eliza said it was a pity I couldn’t give her six shillings for a tea-tray without compelling her to go up-stairs and undress at nine o’clock in the morning. It was not a success.

                However, I had more than one idea in my head. This time I thought I would first find out if there was anything she wanted.

                So on Sunday at tea-time I said, not as if I were meaning anything in particular, “Is there anything you want, Eliza?”

                “Yes,” she said; “I want a general who’ll go to bed at half-past nine and get up at half-past five. If they’d only do that, that’s all I ask.”

                “You will pardon me, Eliza,” I said, “but you are not speaking correctly. You said that was all that you asked. What you meant—-“

                “Do you know what I meant?”

                “I flatter myself that I know precisely—-“

                “Then if you know precisely what I meant, I must have spoken accurately.”

                But as we went to church I discovered that she wanted a new jacket. Her own was trimmed rabbit, and had been good, but the fur had gone bald in places.

                * * * * *

                Next morning I wrote on a sheet of note-paper, “To buy a new jacket. With your husband’s love.” I folded the two sovereigns up in this, and dropped the packet into the pocket of Eliza’s old jacket, as it hung in the wardrobe, not telling her what I had done. My idea was that she would put on the jacket to go out shopping in the morning, and putting her hand in the pocket, get a pleasant surprise. As I was leaving for town, she asked me why I kept on smiling so mysteriously. I replied, “Perhaps you, too, will smile before the day is over.”

                On my return I found Eliza at the front door. “Come and look,” she said, cheerfully. “I have got a pleasant surprise for you.” She flung open the drawing-room door, and pointed. In the middle of the table stood a spiraea, a most handsome and graceful plant. It stood in one of the best saucers, with some coloured paper round the pot, and the general effect was very good. I at once guessed that she had bought it for me with the change from my present to her, and thought it showed very good feeling in her.

                “I hope you have not given too much for this,” I said.

                “I didn’t give any money for it.”

                “I don’t understand.”

                “Well, you must know I had a present this morning.”

                “Of course I know.”

                “Did mother tell you? Yes, she has sent me a beautiful new jacket. Then a man came round with a barrow of plants, and he said he didn’t want money if I had any clothes to spare. So I gave him my old worn-out jacket for this spiraea, and—-“
                I remembered that I had seen the man with the barrow farther down the street.

                “Excuse me for one moment, Eliza,” I said, and dashed out after him.

                * * * * *

                He was a big, red-faced man, and he made no difficulty about it at all.

                “Yes,” he said, “I bought that jacket, gov’ner, and I don’t deny it. There it is at the bottom of my bundle, and I ain’t even looked at it since. Nor I ain’t goin’ to look now. You say there was two suvreigns in the pocket. A gent like you don’t want to swindle a common man like me. If you say the two suvreigns was there, then they’re there now, and I can return yer two pound out o’ my own, in a suttunty of gettin’ ’em back out o’ the jacket pocket. Bless yer! I knows an honest man when I sees one.”

                With these words he drew the money from his own waistcoat pocket, and handed it to me. I took it with some reluctance.

                “Hadn’t you better make quite certain—-“

                “Not a bit,” says he. “If them suvreigns were there when the jacket were ‘anded to me, they is there now. I could see as you was a man to be trusted, otherwise I’d ‘ave undone the bundle and searched long afore this.”

                * * * * *

                “What have you been doing?” said Eliza, on my return.

                “Never mind. Your mother has given you a new jacket. Let me have the pleasure of giving you a new hat.” I pressed the two coins into her palm.

                She looked at them, and said, “You can’t get a hat for a halfpenny, you know, dear. What did you rush out for just now? And why did you have these two farthings gilded? You’ll be mistaking them for sovereigns, if you’re not careful. Were you trying to take me in?”

                I did not quite see what to say for the moment, and so I took her suggestion. I explained that it was a joke.

                “You don’t look much as if you were joking.”

                “But I was. I suppose I ought to know if any man does. However, Eliza, if you want a new hat, anything up to half a sovereign, you’ve only to say it.”

                She said it, thanked me, and asked me to come and help her water the spiraea.

                “It’s such a shapely spiraea,” she said.

                “Yes,” I answered sadly, “it’s a regular plant.” And so it was, though I had not been intending what the French call a double entendre at the time

                “Surprises are beautiful because they come without waiting.” Not so true for Nancy though. She was sure her sister was planning a surprise for her birthday. Pulling open the pink pastel curtains of her bedroom window,  she hungrily drank in the fresh morning air. Her eyes were laced with longing. A soft smile slid across her lips which were otherwise dry with sadness and coated with grief.  Nancy was turning 30 today. “Keep calm. It’s only your 30th birthday”. Humming her favourite song in her head, her lips pursed in, Nancy ran her fingers over her thin wavy short hair. No a strand of grey! Many of her friends were already showing mini zebra stripes in their heads. But, not her! Thank goodness for that.

                She quickly glanced at the mirror and looked away. She never liked looking at the mirror. It always reminded her of what she was not. “Life is just a mirror and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you.” Wally “famous” Amos. Turning her face away from the mirror like it was an enemy on the prowl, a single glossy tear flowed down her cheek. Clutching the ends of her dress, she poured them back in again. She was not going to think of the past and all that it had done to her. She held her palms up and looked at them. Shrivelled walnuts were what they looked like. Lifeless, yet useful. “Nothing worth having, comes easy.”

                All these years she had worked at different factories, clothes, metals, chemicals, shoe, scrubbed the floors at big hotels where perfumed men and women floated easily.  Ever since their parents died, her only goal was to educate Kate, her younger sister. Her emotions came running back to the present. Quickly, she wiped her dried tears and rushed some chirpy cheer on her face. She paced to the door and back.

                “A sister is a little bit of childhood that can never be lost.” Kate was her dream, her hope, her happiness. The gleam of a thousand stars shone on her face as she thought of her sister. Her precious possession. She meant everything to her. She was all she had. Kate shined liked a diamond in a heap of coal. She was an outstanding student and an obedient younger sister. And today, Nancy was sure Kate would surprise her like she did every year. Nancy’s nostrils swelled open in anticipation of the sweet aroma of the freshly baked chocolate cake that would welcome her. Her tongue was eager to lick up the soft, brown cream and her teeth were ready to bite into Kate’s inviting delicacy. She stretched her ears with her hands to hear the sound of Kate’s footsteps coming towards her. She clapped her hands and giggled at her own act of childishness.
                She waited and waited.

                It seemed like an endless wait and a tide of emotions were rushing through Nancy. Finally, she heard her younger sister approaching her room. Her eyes lit up, her steps turned into a spring and her heart grew all  bouncy. She sniffed the air to catch a whiff of the chocolate cake but it was missing. Maybe it was not chocolate flavour this time, she imagined with pride intruding her thoughts. Her sister was all grown up now. She could surprise her with something else.

                Kate walked into her room empty handed. No cake, no flowers, no package wrapped in shiny golden paper, tied with red ribbons. The excitement dissolved from Nancy’s face. Her face looked like a blank, crumpled, white page. Kate was smiling. She could win the world with the radiance of her smile. She gave her sister a tight hug. “Happy birthday” said Kate. Nancy loosened herself from the warm embrace and looked at her sister. “Thank you” she said, smiling coldly. “And here’s your gift” Kate handed her a brown envelope. Nancy’s eyebrows shot up like mountain peaks and her eyes were flooded with questions.

                “Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love is by far the truest type of love. This is your admission letter to the community college. I want you to pick up from where you left.”

                Nancy’s eyes grew moist and her trembling hands were silenced by Kate’s firm grip over them. Nancy shut her eyes tight and let her tears flow as she folded her hands in prayer. Kate’s words sparkled with happiness and shined with guilt as she said “You deserve much more my dear sister, but this is all I can give you.”

I visualised and wished that I would get some big surprise as a birthday gift from the Universe and then I completely forgot about it. But just 15 days before my birthday I was diagnosed with Typhoid. On the day of my birthday I was very weak, bedridden and taking my pills and eating only boiled food. I was unable to talk over the phone so no one called me and my family thought it was not appropriate to bring me cake as I was unable to eat it. It was my birthday evening and I was at home feeling dull.

                The Universe never forgets your wish, and it did not forget mine either, so then it happened. All my friends came over to my place and gave me a big birthday surprise! They brought the cake and a gift which was a branded Jacket, which was also one of my wishes. I had an awesome time with them and felt so happy.

                One day a professor entered the classroom and asked his students to prepare for a surprise test. They waited anxiously at their desks for the test to begin. The professor handed out the question paper, with the text facing down as usual.
                
                Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no questions....just a black dot in the center of the page. The professor seeing the expression on everyone's face, told them the following: "I want you to write what you see there."
                
                The students confused, got started on the inexplicable task. At the end of the class, the professor took all the answer papers and started reading each one of them aloud in front of all the students. All of them with no exceptions, described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc. etc. etc.

No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.
                
                Our life is a gift given to us by God, with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature renewing itself everyday, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see everyday.
                
                However we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on.
                
                The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life.

                Liz was just about finished wrapping up the final details for the
                surprise party she was planning for her husband. She had
                been meticulously preparing for this event, designing every aspect
                of the party from the invitations to the food, and she was very excited
                about it.
                Family members whom Guermo hadn’t seen in years were flying in from Peru in
                a few days. Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
                from various places across the country. The caterer and band were set.
                The best part for Liz: she knew Guermo did not have a clue about the party. She
                could not wait to see the look on his face when he walked into a big “Surprise!” in
                his own home.
                The party was to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about picking
                relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to their hotel, Guermo
                walked into the kitchen and said, quite certainly, “Sweetheart, I don’t want
                anything special done for my birthday.”
                “What do you mean?” Liz responded nonchalantly, though her heart began to
                pound.
                “I mean that I don’t want a surprise party.”
                “Okay,” Liz said with a shrug. “Not a problem.”
                Liz’s mind raced. There was nothing she could do about Guermo’s request now.
                And, frankly, she didn’t want to. Liz had been planning this for more than a year.
                The party would go off as she intended. She did not want all of her effort to be for
                naught.
                When Guermo came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends,
                he was shocked. Tears filled his eyes. (This response was something Liz had not
                predicted.) Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in nearly 20
                years and family members who had come from Peru just for this evening.
                But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry with his wife. He
                felt ambushed. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like people to

                Once upon a time a plump old woman name Tante Adela lived in French Canada.  She lived all alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

                One morning she got up very early as it baking day and there was much to do.  She took a load of wood outside to her oven. 

                “Now why would oven door be open?” she said.  She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in.  But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

                The old woman bent over to look in.  When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut. She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

                When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

                At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw the neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

                “Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick!  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Felix.  “Maybe it is your cat.”

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

                “I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

                Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road.  She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross.  After all, three heads are better than two.

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down its back?”

                “Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath.  “Come right away!  There is a skunk in my oven.”

                “A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

                “Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela.  “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

                “You have a point,” said Louis Ross.  “I will come over as soon as I have finished feeding the chickens.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out.  “You must come to my farm.  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Samuel.  “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela.  “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snark?  I don’t think so!”

                “I will come right over,” said Samuel.  “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

                So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help.  By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there.  Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

                “Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

                “I know that!” said Tante Adela.  “The question is, what to do about it?”

                “I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “She will not be able to bake bread in there for a month!” said Madame Roy, and everyone agreed.

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “And it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel.  He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

                “What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross.  “A dog will bark.  Maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

                “If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

                “What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” said someone else.  “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                So this plan was dropped.  No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers.

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                “Oh, woe is me!” wailed Tante Adela. 

                By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk.  And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come.  Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows.  Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn.  And one by one, everyone found a reason to head home.

                At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard.  The young man may be simple-minded, she thought.  Still, who else could she turn to for help?

                “Jules!” she said.  “Jules Martel.  There is a skunk in my oven.  Can you get him out without scaring him?”
                stop
                What would you do to try and get the skunk out of the oven?

                Jules nodded his head.  He walked over to the oven.  He opened the door and leaned inside.  He spoke in a low voice.  No one could tell what he was saying.  At last he stepped back.  Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway.  Everyone stepped back a few feet.  The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground.

                Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high.  And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “How did you get him to come out?” said Samuel to Jules.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “What DID you say to it?” said someone else.

                “I just told him,” said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, “that if he stayed in the oven any more, he would begin to smell like Tante Adela’s bread.  And if that happened, none of the other skunks would come near him.”

                “Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “That a low creature like a skunk cares about what others creatures like him think of him.”

                “I suppose all creatures must have some sense of self-respect,” said Alice Roy, “no matter who they are.”  Alice Roy and the others nodded in silence

                In just three days, it will be Christmas. Despite the bright and cheery decorations twinkling in the streets, wreaths on doors, and Christmas trees peeking through windows, Hector doesn't feel one drop of joy or excitement. The magic of Christmas seems to have evaporated this year. People passing one another on the street do not wish each other Happy Holidays, smile, or even make eye contact. They simply rush by with their heads down and eyes straight ahead, their minds preoccupied with their to-do lists and avoiding human interaction. 

                Hector doesn't even feel Christmas Spirit from his own family. This morning, he woke up excited to decorate the family Christmas tree with his mother as they did every year. They had barely started wrapping the lights when the phone rang. "Oh dear, it's Aunt Susan!" Hector's mother exclaimed. "Go on without me. I’ll be back." Hector finished the whole tree by himself by the time his mother was off of the phone with her sister. Later that afternoon, Hector's father cancelled their plans to play basketball together. Even Hector's older brother, Yohan, was too busy playing video games to help Hector make shortbread cookies for the family. 

                Feeling discouraged by the lack of festivity around the village and his home, Hector snuggles up with his most comfortable blanket and lets out an enormous sigh. He turns off the light and falls asleep. 

                That night Hector's Native American grandmother, Tallulah, pays him a visit in his dream. Around eight months ago, she left Hector's family to join the great white falcon in the sky. In her gentle voice, she whispers: “Hector, it's up to you to reinvent the magic of Christmas. You can change things. Search in your heart and you’ll find the solution.”

                When he wakes up, Hector cannot stop thinking about his dream. “Reinvent the magic of Christmas,” Tallulah said. He thinks about her words and jots down ideas on a sheet of paper, but crosses them out one by one. Suddenly, his face lights up.

                After lunch, Hector hangs a “do not disturb” sign on the door of his bedroom, closes the curtains, and sits down in his laboratory. This little corner of his room is equipped with a big lamp, magnifying glass, and all the materials from the chemistry set his parents got him for his birthday.

                All afternoon, Hector experiments with various combinations of Christmas ingredients. He melts candy canes and spices into little bowls, then mixes them with some of the plant oils that his grandmother Tallulah handed down to him. The liquid smells pepper-minty and delicious, and Hector feels a rush of optimism. Perhaps this is it! He takes the bowl in his hand and offers a sniff to Zephir, his big striped cat. Zephir's first sniff sends him into a spiral of sneezes. He sniffs the potion once more, then lies down on his back with his feet directly in the air. Hmmmm. Must need some work, thinks Hector. He adjusts the quantities, replaces some of the peppermint with other Christmas ingredients. He looks at Zephir and lets out a joyful shout. 

                Licorice, chocolate chips, cinnamon, star anise powder, three drops of Ayahuasca, a drop of the small seed of Nahele, and two drops of moonflower. He discovered the Christmas Spirit elixir formula!

                Using colored paper from his mother’s desk, Hector cuts, folds, and glues. He makes thirty red, green, blue, yellow, and purple envelopes into which he carefully applies two drops of Christmas Spirit elixir. On each card, he places a sticker of a little elf with a sentence written in capital letters.

                The next day after lunch, Hector gets on his bike. Along each street in the village, he slips a colored envelope under the door of the first house on both the left and right side of every street. Once he finishes all his rounds, Hector returns home. He sits down on his bed and waits. When it's 5 o’clock, he tip-toes downstairs, checks to make sure that no one is looking, then quietly opens the front door and slips outside. Then Hector then walks back into the house, pretending to have just returned home and discovered the little red letter. “Mom, Dad, Yohan, come quick!” He calls. 

                When all four of them are standing together in the living room, Hector reads the label aloud. “Open this letter as a family. After opening me, you should close me again and slip me under the door of the neighbor to your right.”

                The family bubbles with curiosity. Hector's mother grabs the envelope and opens it. A strong scent of chocolate, spice, and incense floats across the living room. Hector's parents and brother stand completely still as the delicious scent surrounds them. Suddenly they begin to move, their eyes sparkling, large smiles slowing spreading across their faces. Hector's father begins to dance, grabbing Hector's mother's hand and twirling her to music only they can hear. They both hum and looking lovingly into one another's eyes. Yohan grabs Hector and lifts him above his head, then begins to spin him around as he used to do when Hector was little. 

                “How about we take the scooters to go look at some Christmas decorations around town?” Hector's mother blurts out, smiling from ear to ear. 

                The family bundles themselves in hats and scarves and coats and rush outside. His brother takes the red scooter, and his father the blue one.

                “Come on, princess, get into my carriage.” Hector's father says to Hector's mother. 

                “Wait!” his mother says. She runs back into the house and grabs the red envelope. When she comes out into the cold again, her husband and two sons are circling around on their scooters. 

                Hector's mother runs across the lawn and stuffs the letter underneath the neighbor's door. She rings doorbell three times and shouts, “Merry Christmas!”

                Then all four of them speed down the street, Hector holding on to his big brother's waist and Hector's mother holding onto Hector's father. Both scooters slide over a large patch of ice, then shoot quickly into a pile of snow. Hector's parents roar with laughter. Hector holds his brother tight.

                Everywhere they go, the village is topsy-turvy. Hector chuckles to himself. His elixir is working! Mrs. Gari and Mrs. Dubois have finally stopped arguing and are building a snowman together, their cheeks rosy with laughter.  The mailman has switched out his black coat for a bright red one. His mailbag filled with candy, and he shouts "Merry Christmas!" as he slings sweet treats out to everyone he passes. On Lilas Street, the family joins an enormous snowball fight. Grown-ups and children alike launch snowballs at one another. Everyone is dodging, jumping, laughing and rolling. On Cerfs Street, a group is playing hide-and-seek among the piles of snow they were once preoccupied with removing from their walkways. Others are sledding, and others are blowing up balloons and releasing them into the chilly afternoon air. Delicious aromas of hot chestnuts, crepes, and nougat float throughout the village. At the large church down the hill, the carousel is all lit up and spinning around. Mostly adults are on it and bob up and down to the happy sound of the music. Hector's father and mother rush over to the merry-go-round. Hector spots his teacher on the ride, sitting in a big fire truck. Hector waves to him with a huge smile.

                His brother walks towards him holding two huge servings of cotton candy. They both sit down on the bench across from the dazzling Christmas tree. While enjoying his treat, Hector smiles. In all the eyes that meet his, there is that little spark that shines, a little spark of happiness that tastes like childhood. “Thank you, Tallulah,” he whispers quietly.

                Today is Ruby’s eighth birthday. Ruby does not know that her parents have arranged a circus party at her grandparents' house. Many of Ruby’s friends are invited to the party. Her little brother John helped his mum make the cake and the cupcakes.

                When Ruby woke up, she yawned. “It’s my birthday today,” she said. She ran down from her room into the kitchen. When Ruby’s mum heard her she hid the cake and the cupcakes. “Happy Birthday Ruby, we are going to take you to a surprise outing today.” “Yes!” Ruby cried, she was so excited.

                Ruby ran to her room and put on her gold sparkly dress, her gold sparkly shoes and a gold headband. She wore her favourite butterfly necklace. It was then time to go.

                Ruby hopped into the car and was amazed as there were balloons and streamers, and her seat was decorated in gold sparkles like a throne. Ruby wondered where her mum, dad and brother were taking her. As she looked outside the window she saw a beautiful rainbow in the bright blue sky, twinkling through the branches. “Hang on a minute,” Ruby said when the car stopped. "We are at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.” Grandma and Grandpa greeted Ruby outside the house. “Happy Birthday Ruby, please come inside,” they said.

                As Ruby walked inside the house she saw steamers and balloons everywhere. Ruby then walked into the backyard and was startled when she saw a big red tent with blue and yellow spots. “What is that? Oh my goodness, it’s a circus,” she cried. She walked into the tent and gasped as she saw many of her school friends. She saw Abigail, Amelia, Ella, Zara, Holly, Hannah, Abby, Elie, Cameron, Monique, Amy, Stephanie, Olivia, Maddison, Brianna, Isabella and her bestfriend Grace. They were all so excited to see Ruby.

                Ruby and her friends ran outside and started playing with her grandparents' dog, Rusty. Rusty was a nice puppy dog that didn’t bite anyone but loved to bite the red striped socks on the washing line.

                The big Jacaranda tree was decorated with sparkly streamers. Under the tree there was a picnic blanket set up with a plate of sandwiches for her and her friends. They all sat together and enjoyed their lunch. Once they finished they heard Grandma call out, “Its time for the circus.” They ran into the tent.

                Inside the tent they saw Grandma dressed as an Acrobat and Grandpa was dressed like a Ringmaster. They started to giggle. A man then walked into the tent with two ponies. Grandpa and the man helped all the children have turns riding on the ponies. After everyone had a turn on the pony, a lady walked in with a big trapeze. The lady helped Grandma swing on the trapeze. Everybody cheered and clapped for Grandma. Then everyone had a turn on the trapeze. They were having a wonderful time.

                When it was time to cut the cake, they all went outside where they saw a big pink circus cake set up on a table under the sparkly tree. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to Ruby. They all had a piece of cake and cupcakes with ice-cream.

                When everyone had left, Ruby ran up to her mum, dad, brother, grandma and grandpa and told them that it was the best birthday she had every had and gave them lots of hugs and kisses.

            story2="""About six months ago, the supervisor of one of my teams left. Since all my other managers were very busy, I stepped in to oversee the team operationally. I was rather rusty and there were many challenges in the team that we needed to conquer and I was a bit overwhelmed. But more about that another one.

                Lisa was a relatively new team member. She was the quiet one in team meetings, slow in adapting to changes and somewhat lacking confidence in her abilities. Due to the changes in the team, I really needed her to step up and expand the scope of her activities. I started to progressively give her new tasks so as not to overwhelm her. However, she kept showing silent or sometimes not so silent resistance to any new activity type, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated.

                After one particularly aggravating incident when she called in sick 30 min after I gave her a new task, I knew we could no longer continue this way. I was planning to have a very tough talk with her and tell her off.

                Fortunately, just then, the Harvard Business Review’s “Why leading with compassion is a better managerial tactic than toughness” article came to me in one of a multitude of serendipitous moments that are sprinkled through my life. It reminded me of something that I already knew well but had for a moment, forgotten in my anger – compassion in leadership promotes employee trust and loyalty.

                With my regained balance, I called her and we started talking. It was still a difficult conversation centered around two areas – what are the reasons for her resistance and what she wants to achieve in our team. Lisa shared that she was a perfectionist and had a strong fear of not completing her tasks as per my expectations and the training she received for her new activities was not sufficient to make her feel confident. She also complained that her current workload does not allow her to take on anything new (which was partially true). She had big ambitions for professional growth, but she did not seem to make the connection that to achieve them, she would need to keep expanding her responsibilities and learning new things. I directed the conversation there and clearly told her that she could not expect growth within my team unless she steps up. It was a stern message to deliver, and I am sure – a difficult one to hear.

                After the conversation, I arranged additional training for her and redistributed some of her work, but honestly, I was not sure she would make it. She had to overcome a deeply instilled fear of failure, and I could not predict whether she would manage.

                Time passed, their new supervisor joined and I stepped back. I could not observe Lisa’s progress very closely anymore, but I noticed that she is taking on more and more responsibilities. I was hesitant to broach the subject with her because I was afraid I would jinx her headway.

                Until a couple of weeks ago, when we had our regular skip-level meeting and she started the conversation with, “Marta, I have been waiting for this conversation. I wanted to tell you that I am not afraid of new things anymore. I realized that the only way you develop is by learning new things. And now when there is a new task, I just go, “bring it on.””

                Let me tell you – I did not stop smiling for three days after that. Fear of failure is one of the most crippling emotions one can experience. And I should know – I have been battling it all my life. But Lisa had managed to shift her focus to her desire for success instead and to keep moving forward. I see a bright future for her in our team.

                Vulnerability is risky on many levels. And it does not help that as managers, we are often taught that vulnerability is a sign of weakness and can damage our professional reputation. Melinda was brought up as a leader in precisely that way. She thought she should focus all work interactions entirely on operational tasks, issues and resolutions. While she gladly accepts others’ vulnerability and is very attuned to their emotions, sharing her own goes against her professional image of herself.

                This approach has brought her excellent results and much success. Still, over time she started realizing that she is not getting everything she needed from her relationships with her manager, her team and her colleagues. She often felt misunderstood and increasingly unhappy.

                Progressively, despite her conditioning to always seem in control and never talk about her own emotions and needs, she started realizing that she would never achieve full job satisfaction unless she opened up. And since this required a great leap of courage, she did it in one big move – in the course of one week, she had meetings with her manager, her team and some of her stakeholders. During those meetings, she, for the first time, managed to express her own feelings and intimate thoughts about her work relationships and her job. She talked about the issues she struggled with and showed up as a human being and not just a manager and professional.

                Since this is not a fairy tale, I cannot lie that everything magically changed after those meetings and now all those relationships are perfect and completely satisfactory for her. But she did open doors for conversations that would never be possible before, and that could eventually lead her to a place of comfort and trust.

                Now, I am often annoyed at people who quote their children and find some profound and deep meaning in everything the kid does or says. But my son is special and very wise (ask anyone who knows him).

                Three years ago, he and his friends encountered an aggressive dog and overnight, he was utterly terrified of anything with a tail. He would cross the street if he would see even a puppy approaching and if a dog got near him, he would scream and jump a mile high.

                This went on for a few months and then Benton appeared. Benton was a small white dog with a brown tail and was my son’s first imaginary friend (he read this and said that Benton was brown with a white rump, but that is not how I remember it). Later he had others too – a cat, a horse, a tiger, an invisible boy. At some point, they went up to eight and it was pretty crowded at home. But Benton was the first one and stayed with us the longest. My son was able to explain what the dog was currently doing at any given moment, and we talked about him often. We even wrote one and a half books about him (I got lazy after that).

                Over time, when we met a dog, after the initial scream, he would look at it and start finding similarities with Benton and show more and more interest in dogs. Two years after Benton came into our lives, my son was able to spend time with dogs and even play with them occasionally. He is still not their biggest fan (we are cat people in our house), but he feels quite comfortable with our friends’ very real dog who lives in our shared yard.

                There is a technique widely used in cognitive therapy called desensitization. It involves controlled exposure to anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus, starting with low intensity and increasing it gradually. I had tried to do that with real dogs, but apparently, no matter how slowly I thought I was moving, it was still too much for him. So he decided to start his desensitization himself with something he can bear – an imaginary dog.

                See, I told you he was wise.

                Man vs. Wild" star Bear Grylls is known for his incredible survival skills and ability to solve problems while facing extreme consequences. To do so, Grylls had to find methods for controlling his feelings of fear.

                "If you really want to live empowered, you've got to face those fears," said Grylls.

                By taking TODAY's Keir Simmons through his high ropes course in Birmingham, England, Grylls gave Simmons the opportunity to control his fear of heights. Grylls encouraged Simmons to breathe through his fear to keep his body from going into panic mode.

                "This now is about trying to control that sense of natural panic that always comes," said Grylls. "If you are not used to it, it can overwhelm people so if we breathe it down, we keep calm, focus on what we are doing."

                By focusing and using Gryll's techniques, Simmons was able to stay focused and accomplish tasks he didn't believe to be possible.

                In an interview on the 3rd Hour of TODAY, Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love talked about experiencing an anxiety attack during a basketball game. He explained how scary it was to have nowhere to hide in the arena.

                "I was out there on the floor. We had just come out of a time out," said Love, "I ran around looking for something that I couldn’t find; I ended up on the floor."

                It was an eye-opening experience for Love and caused him to start taking his anxiety more seriously.

                "I had an episode that really scared me and I didn’t know what to think of it. I thought, you know, this could be it," said Love.

                But Love didn't let a mental health issue end his career. He wants people to know that facing anxiety, while scary, is not uncommon.

                "There are so many people that either in the first person or within arms reach deal with mental wellness, mental health, mental illness on an everyday basis," said Love.

                Love said he also faced a lot of fear in being open about his mental health concerns, but he believes vulnerability can help others.

                Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.

                One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.

                "A great many times, Marina," answered her Aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment".

                Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?

                "I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened".
                "It's true!" said Marina, intrigued, "Can you tell me that secret?"
                "Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear".

                Marina accepted, but she was rather worried. She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this. When her parents took her to bed, she herself put out the light. After a little while, she felt afraid of one of the shadows in the bedroom. Following the advice of Aunt Valerie, she closed the eyes of her face and opened the eyes of her hands. And, summoning up all her courage, she went over to touch that mysterious shadow...

                You have just one more chance to prove you can do it”, the words of my instructor echoed and reechoed in my ears as I got into the plane. Fear was a natural thing, I had heard and I had a common fear which a lot of others had: I was afraid of heights. I had been afraid of even looking down from a high building.

                This fear had been with me from as long as I could remember. It was to overcome my crippling fear of heights that I had decided to join the parachute school. I had gone through a vigorous routine to prepare myself for the big moment. Than at the signal to jump, I had shivered and trembled and started screaming in fear. The instructor had taken me by the hand and led me back into the plane. I was the only one that day who had taken off in the plane and landed-instead of jumping out of it in a parachute. As my companions met me at the base they smirked. I could see that even my good friends were uncomfortable in my presence. I was a failure.

                Then my instructor took me aside. He explained that it was not rare to be afraid. The real valor was in facing and overcoming the fear. I nodded and began to engage in self-talk. In the plane I was still doing this. I kept thinking how I was going to go home and face my parents if I did not get my wings. Then I tried to shutout the fear by imagining myself showing them my wings. The time for the jump grew near.

                The instructor placed his arm on my shoulder to reassure me that I could do it. I nodded and swallowed. My mouth felt dry as I felt the fear arising within me, shiver ran down my spines. I began mumbling affirmations again and then it was my turn. “Jump!” I heard the command and hesitated. “Jump!” shouted the instructor again. I thought no further and took the plunge fairly as I had been drilled.”Bravo” I heard my instructor’s voice in my ears. I fell swiftly and then looked up just in time to see the parachute canopy open above me. Then I looked down.

                As I looked at the beautiful scenario below me, tears glittered into my deep blue eyes, tears of pure joy. I had won. As I floated I remembered all my drills again and began to control my gliding. When I landed, my comrades were upon me laughing and shouting. I could see that they were as contented as I was that I had overcome the greatest enemy of man that is fear.

                Later my instructor landed and gave me a large grin.”I knew you could do it,” he said as he slapped my back, His face beamed with astonishment and mirth. I mumbled my thanks as a smile creased my face and then we ran to the truck with a tremendous feeling of elation.

                “When do we do it again, sir?” I asked the instructor. His reply was drowned in the shouting of my comrades.

                David had avoided flying on airplanes for most of his life because he found himself terrified of crashing. “I couldn’t stop thinking about all the disasters I heard about on the news, and every time I thought about flying, I would begin sweating and my heart started pounding. I only felt better by avoiding travel altogether.”

                But as time went on, David’s fear began to prevent him from doing things he wanted to do. He missed his niece’s graduation and an important work conference, and his fear prevented him from taking his family on the vacation to the coast. “After years of avoidance, I realized this fear was holding me back, and I had to do something about it.”

                David met with a therapist, who encouraged him to examine his thoughts about flying and to question their basis in reality. After some research, David had to admit that his fears about plane crashes were greatly exaggerated in his mind—the flight industry is extraordinarily safe, and accidents are rare. The therapist also taught David some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and visualization, that he could use any time he felt afraid.

                David decided to stop avoiding his fear, and he booked tickets to take his family on their dream vacation. As the flight took off, David focused on keeping his breathing calm and even. Whenever thoughts about crashing entered his mind, he replaced them with a positive thought about how much fun he would have with his family when they arrived. He closed his eyes and imagined the warm sand and waves lapping at his feet, his children laughing and building a sand castle. As the flight progressed, David began to relax. He even enjoyed looking out the window a bit. Anytime he felt himself getting nervous, he gently turned his attention back to his breathing until the feeling passed.

                When the wheels touched the ground, he felt something more powerful than relief: “I felt so proud that I had faced my biggest fear head-on. As we landed, I felt like this thing that had such a powerful hold on me for so long had finally loosened its grip. I knew that I would probably still feel some anxiety when flying, but now I had the tools to face it with mindfulness. I finally feel free.”

                Every day he would see that many frustrated people, people with tears in their eyes and troubled by various worries were going towards Gautam Buddha and they were very happy while returning. That beggar could not understand what Gautam Buddha used to do to them so that they would become very happy? While returning there was neither a lot of money in the hands of the people nor gold and silver, then what happened that people were so happy while returning from Buddha?

                He walked to meet Buddha. Where Buddha was present, there was a very long queue, so that beggar also got in the queue. He started waiting in the queue for his turn. His turn came and he reached near Buddha.

                He said to Buddha, “Buddha I am very poor. I have nothing. I have to beg others even to run my life. Now you tell me that how can I live my life and how can I do it better? “

                On hearing all this the Buddha said, “You are not poor. You think so because till date you have never done anything for anyone. Neither have you ever donated anything to anyone. Nor have you done anything for others.”

                Hearing all this, the beggar was in dilemma. To allay his confusion, the beggar asked, “I am a beggar. How can I donate to people and help people? I have to ask others to run my own life.”

                After hearing all this, Gautam Buddha kept quiet for a while and then said to him, “You have a hand with which you can serve people and do good to others. Also you have mouth so that you say good things and encourage others. You can help others by doing all this. It is not necessary that donations be made only with money. We can also donate education if we want. If the God has given someone a perfectly good body, then he is not poor. He is simply poor in mind. He should move away from this thought and serve others. “

                After listening to all these things of Buddha, that beggar became very happy and his mind was satisfied now.

                Moral of the story – We all waste time worrying that we are poor but this is not true. The truth is that as long as our body is completely better, we can use it to move forward and improve our life. If a person just pays attention to his poverty and does not try to change it then he is a fool.

                Apart from this, we also learn from this story that donations, not only money, education, food, good thoughts, etc. should also be made. If you do not have money, you can education others or you can also share good thoughts to others. This makes society better.

                After some time the person calmed down on his own. Then, the Buddha said, “If someone gives us a gift, it is up to us whether we take it or not. If we accept it, it comes to us. Whereas if we don’t accept it So it goes to the same person who gave the gift. Similarly, it is up to me to accept or not to abort this person. We should never react immediately. We should always calm down and think about right or wrong. It helps to avoid the worst and also gets rid of troubles. “

                After hearing all these things of Buddha, that person became embarrassed and immediately fell at Buddha’s feet and started apologizing to him. The Buddha forgave him and went ahead.

            story6="""Once upon a time, Gautama Buddha was on a journey with his disciples. While walking on the journey, Buddha felt thirsty, so he asked one of his disciples to go and fetch me drinking water.

                Now, when that disciple looked around, no source of water was found anywhere. But when he tried more, he found a source of water on the way.

                There he saw that some people are washing clothes in the source of that water. Then suddenly a bullock cart from there passed over the source of that water. In such a situation, all the water there became dirty and the water became muddy. Then he thought that how can he take that dirty water and muddy water for Buddha?

                So he went back empty-handed and went to Gautam Buddha. He told everyrhing to Buddha. Buddha said that okay don’t worry. We all sit here and relax in the shade of this big tree.

                After some time Gautama Buddha asked the same disciple to bring water again. Now that disciple went back to the same water source. Going there he saw that the water was absolutely clean and was potable. Now he took that water for the Buddha. He gave that water to Gautam Buddha.

                Buddha told everyone that the way mud or the dust spread in the water. But after leaving it for a while, all his mud or dirt sat down and the water cleared back.
                In the same way our brain is also. When our brain is disturbed, then give it time and calm it down. Our brain will also be calm after a short time.

                No decision should be taken with a restless mind. All we have to do is to keep our brain calm for a while so that we can make good decisions. Children’s stories.

                Moral of the story- Decisions taken from a restless mind are always wrong. We should always make a decision with a calm mind, which reduces the chances of making mistakes.

            There was a garden near the palace of King Śuddhodana(Father of Gautam Buddha) where Siddharth used to sit and enjoy nature. One day while he was sitting in his garden, an injured swan fell near his leg. There was an arrow in his body. On seeing the swan, it seemed that some hunter has hunted him.

                Seeing the swan in trouble and seeing it fluttering, Siddhartha’s heart melted and he wanted to help the swan.

                He first took that arrow from the body of that swan and bandaged it with ointment on the injured place. After doing all this, Devdutt came to Siddharth looking for something.

                As soon as Devdutt approached Siddhartha, he said, “Well, it is with you. Bring it to me. I have hunted it. I had to work very hard to hunt it and I have the right to it.”

                On hearing this, Siddharth said to Devadatta, “No, this swan was injured and came to me. I helped it and saved his life. That’s why I have the right over it.”

                There was a debate between the two brothers over the rights of that goose. Now they wanted to know who has more right over that swan? So both of them decided that both of them would go to the king. Siddhartha’s father was the king of Kapilavastu.

                They both went to the king Śuddhodana. As soon as they reached the king, Devdutt first said, “Maharaj, I have the highest authority over this swan because I have hunted it. Because of this you ask Siddharth to give me this swan.”

                As soon as Devdutt’s point was completed, the king pacified both and then asked him what was the whole matter?

                In such a situation, Siddhartha told the king the whole thing and said to him, “Father the thing is that this swan was hunted by Devdutt but this swan got injured and came near my feet. Seeing it injured, I treated it and fixed it. Now tell me that the highest authority on this goose is mine. “

                The king considered this matter well. After considering it, he said one of the biggest things in the meeting and that was, “the right to save more than the one who is killed is the highest. Therefore, the biggest authority over this swan is only and only for Siddhartha because he save that swan. He did not kill it, but treated that swan after seeing it injured and saved its life. After the king had said this, Devdutt understood the matter very well. He also knew that the protector has more rights than the one who killed.

                Moral of the story- From this story we understand that the protector is greater than the one who kill and his authority is greater than the one who is killed. That is why we too should help others and help the troubled people. By doing this we make the society around us better. A good society is the hallmark of a good country. That’s why you also pledge from today that you too will definitely help others.

            story8="""Once upon a time, Lord Gautama Buddha was sitting with his disciples and preaching to them. He then told his disciples, “Anger is the greatest enemy of everyone. The person who is angry not only hurts himself but also harms others. He burns in the fire of vengeance and ruins his life.”

                After his preaching was over, one of his disciples stands up and says to him, “You are a hypocrite! Your words are contrary to the way of life of men. You do not follow what you say, in your life. And tells others to do it all.”

                When his disciple was saying these things to Gautam Buddha, Gautam Buddha did not react and he was sitting silent. But, in such a situation, the person became even more angry and in anger, he spit on the mouth of Gautam Buddha! Even after this, Mahatma Gautama Buddha did not get angry and he was calm. He wiped the spit from his face and he sat quietly.

                Seeing all this, that disciple did not understand what he would do. Enraged, he left that place and went to his house the next day. By the time he reached his home, his mind had calmed down. At the end he realized that he had made a big mistake. He has sinned. He began to say to himself in his mind, “What have I done. I have insulted Mahatma Buddha. How can I commit such a sin. I made a big mistake. I have to go and apologize to him.”

                Saying this, he immediately went to Gautama Buddha but Gautama Buddha was not at that place. In such a situation, the disciple wandered from place to place and started searching for him. As soon as he got the Buddha, he fell at his feet and started saying to him, “Forgive me. I have made a mistake. I have insulted you. I have committed this great sin.”

                Seeing all this, Gautam Buddha said to him, “Calm down, tell me what’s the matter? Who are you?”

                When Gautam Buddha asked this, he was shocked. He started thinking how Mahatma Buddha could forget him. He had insulted him.

                Thinking this, he asked Mahatma Buddha, “I am the same disciple who insulted you yesterday and you forgot me so soon.”

                “We should leave the things of yesterday. Whether it is good or bad, we should not think about it again and again. I leave the past and go forward and so should all of us.” Mahatma Buddha said to that disciple.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another with a few of his disciples. While they were travelling, they happened to pass a lake. As Buddha was thirsty, he told one of his disciples to get some water from the lake.

                The disciple gladly obliged and walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that a few people were washing their clothes in the lake and right at that moment, a bullock cart was crossing through the lake. As a result, the water had become muddy and foul. The disciple couldn’t possibly take the dirty water to Buddha. So he returned to Buddha and told him the water was dirty and not fit to drink.

                A half hour later, Buddha again told the disciple to get water from the same lake. The disciple, though perplexed, obediently agreed and walked up to the lake. This time, however, the disciple noticed that the water was crystal clean. The mud had settled down and the water was fit to drink. So he collected some water in a pot and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the pot of water and smiled.

                He said, “See what you did to make the water clean? You did nothing. You just let it be. The mud settled on its own and you got pure water. Your mind is exactly like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it some time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put any effort to calm your mind. It will happen. It’s effortless.”

                Buddha’s message is crystal clear. Achieving inner peace is effortless. It is not something to struggle for. It is an effortless process which will happen on its own. The practice of mindfulness is central to Buddhist philosophy where one observes the thoughts without passing any judgment or reacting to them. There are several mindfulness meditation techniques that can help us in achieving a calm and peaceful state of mind.

                My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter. I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter’s giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through...I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter's giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through her child’s merry eyes.
                We talked about the carefree laughter of childhood before we had bills to pay and so many responsibilities.
                I asked my daughter, "So what makes you laugh when you get older, and the children are grown, and you no longer have to leave cookies out for Santa?"
                "I don’t know, Mom, she said. That’s what I’m expecting you to show me."
                That’s the thing about children; when you think they are grown and you’ve set good examples for them, they remind you that they’re still watching.
                Our children grew up in a pastor's home with many different kinds of people coming and going in their lives in many different places. Teaching our children to have a sense of humor was just as important as teaching them to have a strong prayer life.
                One of my many favorite memories of laughing together as a pastor's family was when a precious older member of our church, who was almost blind with cataracts, would prepare meals and bring them to us. She didn't realize that she mixed all the food on one big serving plate.
                The fried fish was often on top of cottage cheese and pineapple with beans and slaw on top of that. The children wouldn't eat the food and didn't know what to say when she asked them at church how their dinner was.
                A pastor friend suggested we name our garbage can "Spot." So when the sweet lady asked the kids how the food was, they would say, "It hit the spot!" Laughter always made our lives fun and helped us get through stressful times.
                We need laughter in the good times and the bad. Laughter makes us feel good, releases pressure in a bad situation, gives us energy, and makes the most miserable situation bearable at times. In general, it gives us a sense of well-being and a sense of community.
                Doctor Madan Kataria, author of the book, Laughter Yoga, said, "Children can laugh up to 400 times a day, but for adults, this frequency drops to barely 15 times a day."
                It may even be less this year with all the stress our country and families have been through.
                In 1995 Dr. Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai, India, experimented with humor’s therapeutic benefits by approaching strangers in a park in Mumbai. He then invented a series of breathing and relaxation exercises that stimulate merriment for better health called Laughter Yoga.
                Since then, thousands of social laughter clubs have been launched in 65 countries, including the United States.
                Some physicians prescribe laughter classes to the sick, elderly, young, and healthy for its stress-reducing effects. It is proven that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter.
                The physical benefits of laughter include reducing stress hormones, strengthening our immune system, cardiac conditioning, lower blood pressure, {especially in women), and it cleanses the lungs, which can aid in respiratory problems.
                Good reason to add laughter to our lives daily, right?
                When I added up the amount of laughter in my life, I found that most of the people I spend time with are people who like to laugh.
                As inspiration, I look no further than my own friends and family. My neighbor and friend is one particular person who inspires me. She is engaged, curious, strong, beautiful, and fun at age 89 ? exactly the kind of woman I'd love to be when I'm her age, should I have the good fortune to live that long in fine health.
                Listening to her share funny stories of stressful times in her life growing up during the great depression reminds me that there is a funny side to every situation. Spending any time with her reinforces the idea that we need a sense of humor to make it through the tough times in life and gives me new energy and hope for the future.
                My sisters, who were all more than ten years older than me, inspired me the same way. They knew how to use laughter as a healing agent. When we got together, we talk about our life as children. There were sad and painful times for us, but we always managed to turn our shared stories and thoughts into laugher that brought tears to our eyes.
                During the Covid-19 quarantine, I had an amazing friend who sent me videos of funny things and attitudes to cope with the quarantine. She says we need more comedy in our lives, and she is right. The videos were respectfully humorous, and they helped me laugh at myself.
                Laughter doesn’t mean you can’t be serious or that you are insensitive to the bad things happening in the world around us.
                However, it can be the difference between a life of black-and-white and a life filled with color. Laughter may not add years to your life, but it will add life to your years! It’s like a flower that blooms when it stretches towards the sun.
                A wise person realizes eating right and exercise is the best way to stay healthy, and it is a wise person who learns the importance of laughter in their lives.
                If we need a prescription for laughter, it can be found in a book that has been around a long, long time. A Bible verse in Proverbs reminds us that joy is an important part of a healthy life. "A merry heart is good like a medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength." (17:22, NLT)
                Laughing with our grandchildren is the most fun, and we do it a lot. Sometimes when our grandchildren get into trouble, we laugh and remind our children they did the same things when they were that age. But, for some reason, they don't always think that's funny.
                However, being a role model for our adult children has meant demonstrating how to live well and happy in good times and bad. Teaching them always to have a sense of humor and a strong prayer life will be their guide to setting the same example for their children."""

He said, “Having a wooden leg has its benefits. It cannot get injured and so does not pain!”  Then he called a patient and gave him a stick. “Hit and see.” That patient, Uluk hit Kanduk’s leg with all his might. Kanduk started laughing. He said, “See, I didn’t get hurt.” Everybody smiled looking at Kanduk. After visiting Champa, Kanduk and Tandul returned home. Kanduk began stroking his leg. Seeing this, Tandul asked, “What happened?”  “Uluk hit me on my real leg by mistake. If I wouldn’t have laughed, how would I have brought smiles on so many faces? It was a small price to pay to make others laugh.” said Kanduk and laughed out loud. Tandul was amazed and said “You are great! Kanduk. You can laugh despite the pain. Laughter is the best Medicine.”

                story3="""Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as “terminally ill”. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500.
                He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, “If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?”
                He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find – Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something funny.
                His pain was so great he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
                He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy, healthy and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
                Some people think laughter is a waste of time. It is a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to indulge in only every so often.
                Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we’re not well, laughter helps us get well; if we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
                Since Cousins’ ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind and the emotions.
                So, if you like laughter, consider it sound medical advice to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don’t like laughter, then take your medicine – laugh anyway.
                Use whatever makes you laugh – movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, New Yorker cartoons, jokes, friends.
                Give yourself permission to laugh – long and loud and out loud – whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you’re strange, but sooner or later they’ll join in even if they don’t know what you’re laughing about.
                Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure. . . laughter.

                “Oh. Hello.” She tried to sound normal. She didn’t feel normal. She felt like she was teetering on the edge of something. That feeling where you’re not sure if it’s laughter or tears — both hysterical — that will come out of your body.
                “I’m lichen it.” His voice was deep, laconic. Australian.
                “What?” Her brow furrowed. The green mask hid her mouth.
                “I’m lichen it.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. The weird feeling was still there. Tears? Laughter? She wasn’t sure, but when it came, she knew she’d have no control. None.
                You see, she’d been locked inside her two-roomed ‘palace’ for 21 days. The whole weird world lockdown had triggered her already fragile self into going into herself, into self-isolation. For longer than 14 days because…well…you never can tell. I mean, perhaps she had touched a metal hand-rail when she took the train, or when she’d walked into the toilets at the cinema. There were germs everywhere. And now they had a name.
                “Barry.” She looked at him, fully into his face, her mouth a little slack with surprise. Her eyes, wide.
                “What?” She wondered if he some kind of telepathy.
                “My name. Barry. And I’m lichen it!” He grinned at her. The lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. And his eyes twinkled. The smile was cheeky. He had no mask. Brave. His brown hair flopped onto his forehead. He had a black t-shirt on, AC/DC on the front.
                She must have looked a little puzzled. Although he could only see her eyes, they must have shown her confusion. He started to laugh. It was a deep laugh. Straight from his belly. It was lovely!
                “The bench! We’re sitting on…” he gesticulated. His hands were broad and capable. Clean too. Fingernails, neat. Blonde hairs on the backs of his hand glistened in the sun.
                It was then she noticed. She who notices everything. Every hair follicle. Every leaf on every tree. Every blade of grass. Every freckle dusting Barry’s arm.
                The bench was covered in lichen!
                She felt it. Not the lichen but the laughter. Bubbling up, like a soda bottle, shaken not stirred. It bubbled up and up and out of her! Such laughter, a beautiful sound! A beautiful feeling! The lichen!
                “I’m lichen it!” he grinned at her again, obviously glad she had reacted.
                She pulled at the mask hiding her mouth, gulping the air as the laughter came, flowing like a stream.
                How could she be laughing? With a stranger? On a park bench? At this time in the world’s history?
                But it wouldn’t be stopped. It flowed! Her every nerve, cell, neuron, given life by laughter, glowed in the sunlight. She put the mask down next to her.
                “So, you’re a lichen expert then,” she chortled, leaning over with the laughter pouring out of her. He began to laugh too.
                “I know what I’m lichen,” he replied, “And I’m lichen you!” His whole face contorted as his laughter burst out of him! He slapped his thigh, leaning backward and forwards as the hilarity took control of him.
                She tried to reply, feeling the peeling lichen under her hands. Laughter had taken control of her. All her fears disappeared in wave after wave of glorious giggles.
                She stood up, held her hand out to him.
                “Come on, Barry! I’m lichen you too! Let’s make like a tree and leave!” She let out a huge gust of laughter. Barry grabbed her hand and stood up, laughing his wonderful belly laugh.
                They wandered off. Who knows where? Nothing was open so perhaps they went back to her place. She left the mask behind.

                Mom dragged the sack into the kitchen of our home in suburban Sherwood Park, Alta. My 10-year-old brother came into the room: “What’s in there? It’s moving.”
                I gave a piercing, seven-year-old-girl shriek. Something in the lumpy bag was struggling to escape. Mom spun around. “Oh, shi—shoot. Take it to the garage.”
                My brother hauled the bag away. In the garage, Mom grabbed the axe from its spot on the wall. Dark-jacketed men, mysterious packages and now axes, I thought. It was turning out to be an interesting day.
                Mom approached the bag like a bomb-squad member, opened the top and retreated a few feet. There was a rustle and then a chicken with a partially detached head blasted out. Dad was a thrifty man, unable to resist the Hutterite’s price for unplucked, freshly killed (or, in this case, mostly killed) poultry.
                The chicken, delighted to be free of the cramped bag and its deceased kin, made several leaps around our garage, like a spasmodic ballerina. Mom’s former-farm-girl know-how abandoned her, and she looked a little sick. She handed my brother (whose closest experience with a live chicken was an undercooked nugget) the axe. “Chop its head off,” she said.

Until he arrived, she eyed the door as though the chicken might grab the axe itself and hack its way through.

                It’s been 30 years since then, and Kerry is still charmingly gul­lible. I think it’s about time we finally told her the truth about how babies are made.

                A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''


                story_raudra2=  '''Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                No scolding, no timeouts
                It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                Playing soccer with your head
                Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                Why don’t you hit me?
                Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

                story_raudra3= '''Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

                story_raudra5= '''Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                Moral of the story:

                Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

                story_raudra6='''A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''

                story_raudra10= '''One night a snake... while it was looking for food, entered a carpenter’s workshop.
                The carpenter, who was a rather untidy man, had left several of his tools lying on the floor.

                One of them was a saw. As it went around inside the shop, the snake climbed over the saw, which gave it a little cut.

                At once, thinking that the saw was attacking it, the snake turned around and bit it so hard that its mouth started to bleed, enraging the snake even more. The snake continued to attack the saw over and over again until the saw was covered with the snake’s blood. Sadly, the snake did not realize what was actually happening.

                Dying from its own wounds, the snake decided to wrap itself around the saw and began to squeeze with all its strength but alas! it ended up killing itself.

                Sometimes during certain life situations, we react with anger not realizing that we are only hurting ourselves. In life it's better to sometimes ignore situations, people and their behavior. People say and do things but it's our decision whether to react in a positive or in a negative way.

                The carpenter and his tools in this story are like those unpolished, insensitive people and their equally insensitive utterances that cut us in the heart, hurt our sentiments, and cause us emotional damage. But it is up to us to either ignore them and go our way without letting their words touch/harm us or to react foolishly like the snake in this story and end up in a miserable condition due to our short-temper.

                “Soft answers remove anger, Rough words raise rage.”
                I would also say to all foster mom or aunts to understand that they are hurting themselves in a long run'''


                story_raudra11=  '''The school bus would arrive at any moment. Parth hurried to a table to drink his milk. Just then Bhakti, Parth's younger sister arrived there. She took a plate for her breakfast. Her hand mistakenly touched the glass of milk and the milk spilled over Parth's uniform.
                The ripple effects of anger
                "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.
                He was praying all the way that his class teacher should be in a good mood and pardon his coming late. But no prayers of pardons seemed to work for D.K sir. Parth's punishment was to go out on the ground and run one mile. He felt very embarrassed. All the way while running, Parth was burning inside. He blamed Bhakti for his punishment and was waiting to return home and scold her.
                He was very tired and exhausted because of his anger. When he returned home, he saw that Bhakti was studying for her geography test. "Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu", Bhakti was memorizing the capitals of Indian states. Parth entered the room and heard Bhakti's voice.
                "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                The ripple effects of anger2
                His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

                I just never knew you would turn out to be so much harmful; else, never I must have bothered to you. A friend would never do something like what you did. I indeed feel unenviable to recollect the fact that we were friends.

                I remember when I first met you. It was quite a sunny day, and our first day at college. Students of the new batch were to assemble in the main hall. It was the first time when I caught a glimpse of you. You were in your red shorts and a plain black t-shirt, with a ponytail and you looked very fine. Some boys even wanted to talk to you. I purposely stood next to you. I genuinely thought you might be a generous girl with a firm attitude. Our college principal began his speech to his New Year students and we stood straight.


                
                Suddenly a choking voice of the microphone came out of the speakers in a very harsh voice, some of the students started laughing about it, and you were one of them. You shouted and howled like a guy, and it was outrageous to see a girl doing such stuff. You suddenly turned to me and laughed, expecting that I too must laugh on this, but I just smiled at you gladly. I was very happy to get your attention, but your behavior wasn’t comforting. I desperately needed a friend in the new college, new town and most importantly a new life after school.

                We were to move back to the mess for the food. I again purposely sat next to you, hoping to have a conversation. You took my presence and began talking to me. Really, you were too amiable to me. You did not let me feel that was our first conversation, especially the way you hit me on my back repeatedly, just as if how usually boys do! I learnt you love sports, and basketball was your game. Well, it was too obvious to know, you were a tomb boy. But whatever you were, I was happy to have a good-looking sport-loving girl as my friend. We exchanged our numbers and came in contact. You lived in the college residence but I lived with my relatives in the town.


                
                Then we kept on meeting very often. Gradually, we went on being good friends. Nevertheless, you made me feel deplorable sometimes the way you dealt with others. You often cracked jokes on others, badgered and annoyed our classmates with your irritating tricks and abused girly girls for the way they dressed themselves. Sometimes, you did not spare even me with your endurable spirit of teasing. People asked me huge times to remain away from you. They all had come to know we didn’t share any single quality and that I was just being nice to you. Unfortunately, their perception was true. Many a times I felt like I should quit your friendship, but one thought always stopped me to proceed, as you were the only friend of mine, who was so popular, handsome and undeniably, my first friend in the college. But it was becoming too harder to remain friends with you.

                After a lot of patience, I decided to get separated from your friendship. I started ignoring you a bit, like if you appeared in my sight, I pretended as if I have not seen you. But I guess you caught me. You soon understood my ignorance. You came to me and directly asked me if there was anything wrong. This one single thing was only appreciating, that you were always straight in your talks. You never tangled the confusions or talked indirectly, which I definitely lacked. I then settled things by providing lame explanations. Somehow you accepted and never bothered about my ignorance as you were too much busy with your sports.


                
                Our first year came near to end. You won us the inter college basketball championship, as the captain. Principal and every one appreciated for your efforts. Really, we all were proud of you. Unluckily our exams were just one month after. You did not study the entire year and were always engaged in your basketball shots and strategies. You were horrified to see such lny syllabus and were all confused. You asked me to help you in studies. I agreed. However, I just did not know you thought me a fool. You wanted me to complete all your assignments and projects. I somehow did. You wanted me to teach you like a tutor, fill your mind with everything given in our textbooks. I agreed to explain you though, but you were not satisfied with whatever I taught you. You treated me very gratingly as if I owed a lot to you. I did every possible thing for you to get ready for exams, but still you were not gratified. You wanted more out of me; you wanted me to give more and more time to you. But I had to study for my exams too.I tried to tell you indirectly that I can’t do anything more than this, but I guess you did not want to understand my problems.


                
                I was extremely chafed by your behavior. I then decided to completely dismiss, no matter what. I began ignoring your calls and messages. I switched off my cell phone. You were annoyed by this attitude of mine and got impatient. You visited me at my place un-announced, and burst in anger. You capper clawed, yelled and abused me as if I did a crime by not giving attention to you. As soon as you left, I uttered a great cry and kept on weeping that whole night.

                We were not friends anymore. I decided never to talk to you, so did you. After that day, we often saw each other; but we turned our heads in other directions each time. Nevertheless, I’m just not hesitant to tell you, that now I actually love life without you. Moreover, I need you to know, that Friend, you are not tolerable!

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...

                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                Once upon a time there was a zombie called Patizombi, who was fed up with being the villain in everyone’s stories. So, to prove that he could do good, he decided to go hunting evil ghosts.

                But ghosts aren’t very visible and they’re sneaky too. It was only after many failed attempts that Patizombi spotted a confused ghost floating through the forest. He approached it carefully, set out his traps and jumped on him.

                The battle was going very badly until Patizombi realized that he was in fact not fighting a ghost but a clingy bedsheet he’d been trapped by.

                “Ha, ha, ha! You have fallen right into my trap, you evil zombie!” A ghost laughed, emerging from his hiding spot.

                “Ahh, evil ghost,” Patizombi replied. “I’ll catch you one day.”

                “No, no, no, no and no!” said the ghost, incredibly offended. “Excuse me, but I am a good ghost and my job is to hunt evil zombies.

                “Oh no you don’t!” objected Patizombi, “because I am a good zombie, and I am the one who hunts evil ghosts.”

                After arguing for a little while, they realised they were both telling the truth. They found it funny and became friends.

                “I suppose not all ghosts are evil…”

                “Nor all zombies…”

                “We could join forces to hunt ogres”

                And they headed as a team into the mountains, where the most fearsome ogres were hidden. Working quickly together, they found the track of an ogre that led them to a cave. As the ogre was out, they prepared a trap but while they were doing so a giant stone fell and blocked the entrance leaving them trapped.

                “Ha, ha, ha! it was so easy to trap that evil zombie and his ghostie partner!”

                “Lies!” they protested from inside, “We are not evil. The only evil one is you and we have come to catch you!”

                Once again, the discussion carried on until everyone was persuaded that none of them was evil.

                “We would never have thought that good ogres existed”

                “Neither would I have thought that a zombie and a ghost were not evil”

                It is obvious that, before you set out to hunt anyone, you need to make sure that they are evil...

                That is how they discovered that, even if a creature has a reputation for being evil, it is not always true. And this is also true for all other creatures who have a reputation for being dirty, noisy or annoying: you can never tell which ones are actually like that without first getting to know them. That is how they found many more zombies, ghosts and good ogres who joined their group of catchers of evil creatures. Everyone trusted this valley police force, which never allowed anyone to be treated badly due to prejudice and to bad reputations they did not deserve.

                There was once a fairy who was learning how to be a fairy godmother. Most magic and wonderful, she was the kindest and cleverest of all fairies. However, she was also a very ugly fairy. And no matter how much she showed her wonderful qualities, it seemed that everyone was determined to believe that the most important thing about a fairy was her beauty. In the fairy school they ignored her, and every time she flew off on a mission to help a child or anyone else in trouble, before she could say a word they were already screeching and yelling at her: "Ugly! Get out of here, weirdo!"

                Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful. But then she remembered what her mother had always told her: "My dear, you are what you are, warts and all; and never doubt that you are this way for a very special reason..."

                But then, one day, the witches of the neighbouring land invaded and destroyed the country, putting all the fairies and wizards in prison. Our fairy, just before being attacked, put a spell on her own clothes and, helped by her ugly face, she managed to pass for a witch. That way she was able to follow the witches back to their den.

                Once there she used her magic to prepare a big party for everyone, decorating the cave with bats, toads and spiders. The music was provided by a pack of howling wolves. While the party was in full swing, the fairy hurried off and set free all the fairies and wizards who had been imprisoned. When all of them were free, they worked together on one big spell which succeeded in trapping the witches inside the mountain for the next hundred years. And for the next hundred years, and more, everyone remembered the great bravery and intelligence of the ugly fairy.

                And from that day on no one in that land ever saw ugliness as a disgrace. Whenever someone ugly was born, people were filled with joy, knowing that for that new person great things lay ahead.

                Mr. Horsefly was the new head of the prairie post office. He had put a lot of time and effort into getting this highly respected position; he had even moved fields. If you asked Mr. Horsefly, he would tell you that he got the job thanks to his great deductive gifts.

                On his first day at work, he opened up shop, and into the post office came Mr. Beetle, Mrs Spider, Miss Mantis, and Mr. Grasshopper.
                Mr. Horsefly wouldn't let them so much as open their mouths.

                "Don't tell me, don't tell me. I bet I can work out what each of you came for," he said, putting a book, a plastic mat, a nail file, and some protective goggles on the counter.

                "The nail file will be for Mrs. Spider, without a doubt. With all the scratching she does, she'll need to put her nails right. “The mat”, he went on, without giving anyone time to react, "without even having to think about it, I give it to Mr. Grasshopper, since he must have to train pretty hard to keep all his hopping about up to a decent standard. The safety goggles have to be for Mr. Beetle, because having to spend all day with his face so close to the ground, he'll be needing something to protect his eyes. And finally, this big book here, has to be a Bible. I'll have to give that to Miss Praying Mantis, whom I would like to ask to include me in her supplications to The Almighty. As you will see..."

                They didn't let him finish. The comment about the mantis - well known on the prairie for having changed her name from Miss Praying Mantis to simply Miss Mantis - was just too much for everyone, and they burst out laughing...

                "Not much of a detective, are you!" said Mr. Grasshopper, between chuckles. "For a start, Mrs. Spider came for the book. She's very quiet, and doesn't scratch a soul. The mat is for Mr. Beetle, who likes to sunbathe in his swimming pool, and do it lying on his back. Miss Mantis will, of course, want the nail file. She's a bit of a flirt, you know. And the protective goggles are for me. I'm not as young as I was, and don't see to well. These days when I'm hopping on the grass I get the odd black eye..."

                “Uhu”, Mr. Horsefly interrupted, recovering a little from his embarrassment, "then you do, in fact, hop on grass!"

                "Yes, I do," answered the grasshopper, "but as you'll see, making your deductions based simply on prejudice, leads to more misses than hits..."

                How right he was! Just a few days later, after having met all the insects in person, Mr. Horsefly had a good laugh while telling this story about his deductions made from prejudice without yet having met a soul. And he understood that judging without knowing is a practice for fools.

                XT-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read "XT-27: The best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other XT-27s.

                "All robots should be like us XT-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the XT-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

                One day, he was walking along in Bionic City, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors (that's eyes to you and me, but XT-27 liked to use highly technical sounding words for everything).

                He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an XT-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were XT-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing!

                Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XT-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble (a house), on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were XT-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more.
                On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time.

                So XT-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another XT-27.
                So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push...
                When he woke up, the XT-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The XT-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The XT-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "XT-28, the best, most modern robot".
                So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The XT-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn't feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points.

                That first night he was paralysed with fear, his mind full of monsters. So much so, that he went over to his wardrobe to get a torch. But when he opened the wardrobe door he came face to face with a monster, and he let out the loudest scream in the world.

                The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and... started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there.

                The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair.

                The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons... It was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends.

                And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.

He cast a spell, and from that moment, every insult they directed at the old man made the old man better, but had the opposite effect on the goblin who was doing the insulting. Of course, the goblins knew nothing about what was happening. The more they called the man an "old fool", the younger and sharper of mind he became, while the goblin who had shouted at him aged rapidly, and became a little more foolish.

                Reggie couldn't hear a thing. He was a normal boy, but he had been born deaf. He was well known to everyone in town, and they were all very fond of him. Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby.

                Reggie didn't like this very much. But the person who disliked it the most was his friend Michael, who decided one day that things had to change. Michael's father was the town´s Mayor, and Michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of Reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs.

                People liked the idea, because everyone loved Reggie. The day became known as The Day of Silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: Reggie was amazing!

                On that day no one was thinking of Reggie as just a deaf person. This meant he could be treated just like any other little boy; and people saw a whole new side of him. Not only that, but Reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, Reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all Reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference.

                So the Day of Silence was the day Reggie´s true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head. A helmet with great thick ear flaps; a helmet which meant you couldn't hear the slightest thing.

                Pete Sparks was a sensitive boy. So sensitive that even his hair was ticklish. You only had to touch his hair a little bit and he would burst out laughing. And when this ticklish laughter started, no one could make him stop.

                So Pete grew up used to strange situations. When his granny’s friends came to visit, he would always end up in stitches because there was never any shortage of little old ladies rubbing his head and saying “How cute!”

                Windy days were the worst, with Pete on the ground, paralyzed by laughter whenever the breeze blew on his locks, which, incidentally, were pretty long because at the barber shop no one could manage to cut his hair, due to the non-stop giggling. To see Pete laugh, as well as being great fun, was terribly contagious. When Pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing.

                As Pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places. Some activities are serious business, and cannot be done amid gales of laughter. So Pete tried everything to control his ticklishness: he tried wearing a thousand different hats, he used ultra strong hairsprays and gels, he shaved his head, and he even went on a yoga course to see if he could bear the tickling by learning to relax himself.

It didn’t take long to make Pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown.

                “I have no one to replace me”, said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do”. Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought “serious? A clown?”, trying to understand what the old man had told him.

                “Come, I’ll show you” said the clown.

                So the clown took Pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show Pete’s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter.

                When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at Pete and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age”.

                “It’s true,” answered Pete, smiling and returning the wink, “not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. And that’s so hard to find”. This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter.

                And that is how Pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that Pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days. While they were traveling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.

                The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha, The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.

                After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.

                Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.

                What did Buddha emphasize here? He said, It is effortless. Having 'peace of mind' is not a strenuous job; it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment, such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.

The picture was perfect. Most of the people who viewed the pictures of peace from various artist thought that it was the best among all.

                But when the king announced the winner,  everyone was shocked. The picture which won the prize had a mountains too but it was rugged and bare. The sky looked very angry, there were lightning.  This did not look peaceful at all. It looked like the artist has mistakenly submitted his painting depicting storm rather than peace.  But if anyone looked closely at the painting, he could see a tiny bush growing in the cracks in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her next. In the midst of the rush of angry weather, the bird sat on her nest with peace.

                The peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise or trouble. Peace means to be in the midst of all the chaos and still be calm in the heart. The real peace is the state of mind, not the state of the surroundings. The mother bird at her her calm, despite her chaotic surrounding indeed was the best representation for peace.

                – It is simple, – he said. — I will destroy all weapons on the Earth, and nobody will be able to fight anymore.

                – It would be great! –people exclaimed.

                The magic wand’s wave – and this was done.

                There was a peace on the planet for three days, while the majority of those who were prone to fight, sought and could not find a weapon. When they understood they’ve lost it forever, they have made spears of young trees and started to fight again.

                When the wizard heard this bad news, he said:

                – Do not worry. I will destroy all young trees, so that they will not be able to fight.

                After two or three days of useless search for young trees, suitable for making spears, rebellious people started to cut giant trees, make batons from them, and the bloodshed has started again. The Wizard destroyed all big trees. Then humans made knives and swords of metal. He destroyed all metal on the planet. People made sling and began to throw stones at each other. It was necessary to destroy the stones, too. And then peacekeepers began to worry: all trees have disappeared; there is no metal and stones. How to live, what to eat now? There will be no vegetation soon, and people will die without even fighting. No, this is a wrong solution of the problem.

                The Wizard became confused:

                – I do not know how to behave now. I would have destroyed all humanity, but, unfortunately, it is not in my power!

                The peacekeepers fell into despair; they did not know what to do. And then one clever kid turned to the Wizard.

                – I know what you should do. Let people feel, how others perceive their actions. If one person hurt someone, let him feel the same pain, and if he brings joy to someone, let him feel the same joy. So no one will hurt each other, because he will feel the pain immediately too and would have to stop.

                All people were inspired with the greatness of kid’s thought, and the wizard realized his idea. He returned all trees, stones and metals.

                Since that day nobody on the planet tried to hurt his neighbour, because he would have to feel the same pain too. People began to help each other, because they liked the sense of joy they felt at this moment. And they began to live in harmony and joy.

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...
                
                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block.
                He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did U take all this time to come? Don’t U know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t U have any sense of responsibility?”
                Th…e doctor smiled & said:”I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call…… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work”
                “Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would U calm down? If your own son dies now what will U do??” said the father angrily.
                The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”
                “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.
                The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,“Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If U have any question, ask the nurse!!”
                “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
                The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”
                The patient father remained speechless.

                There was a monk who lived on the edge of a small town, much to the delight of the townspeople. Whenever he ventured into town to help someone, everyone came out of their homes to give him gifts from their gardens, calling out to him, "Oh, Teacher, we're so fortunate to have you living nearby! You are such a wonderful person! You do so much good, Teacher! Your presence is such a blessing!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                One day a young woman came to the monk's hut and said, "Oh, Teacher, I'm in terrible trouble. I'm pregnant and my family will disown me. The young man who I love so much has fled to another town because my family would certainly do him harm. I have nowhere else to turn and no one else to ask for help."

                The monk replied that she could live in the back room and help around the house and she would then have the security of a home for her child.

                Well, now when the monk went into town, he was reviled. "You dirty old man! Look how you have betrayed our trust and taken advantage of that young woman! How could we have ever believed in you? What shame you have brought on us!" And they hurled rotten fruit at him along with their insults.

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                After a while, the father of the child returned to the town and presented himself before the family, saying, "I have spent the past two years learning a trade in a neighboring town and now I am able to provide a home for your daughter and grandchild." The family was overjoyed. Although it wasn't the best of situations, it was so much better than they had feared that they welcomed their daughter and grandchild back into the family with open arms.

                How different it was when the monk came into town then. The townspeople lined the road every time, presenting him with gifts of food and calling out, "Oh, Teacher, how could we have ever doubted you? Look at the wonderful thing you have done! We are so ashamed! Please forgive us! You are such a wise and compassionate person! We are so fortunate to have you living nearby!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                While there is no single interpretation that would do justice to this story, it certainly speaks to the equanimity of the monk. Against the backdrop of praise and condemnation, he holds himself apart from "what everyone thinks" even as he acts with the most compassionate and involved sense of responsibility. Whether in public or the workplace or in the privacy of home life, people will misread our intentions and jump to conclusions that cast us in a bad light. The most straight-forward lesson of this story, then, is that by continuing on the most ethical course of action our true intents become known. This, however, can be a short-lived vindication as the same thing may happen all over again: We ought not be pulled off-center by shallow praise any more than by shallow criticism.

                The monk in this story serves as a model by maintaining emotional detachment from the transient opinions of others while never withdrawing from personal involvement with others' real needs

                A woman whose husband died unexpectedly faced dire circumstances. Creditors hounded her, taking everything away from her and her young son. Fearing she might lose the most valuable possession of the family, she hid the priceless jewel that had been handed down for generations by sowing it into the sleeve of an old coat that the creditors would never want. The troubles weighed on her grief and eventually broke her spirit and she died without ever telling her son about the jewel.

                The boy found himself without family or home, his only inheritance the old threadbare coat that the creditors left him. He found work wherever he could, staying in barns or out in the forest, exposed to the elements and grave hardship. Filled with sorrow at his fate, he endured the passing years with an abiding belief in the unfairness of life.

                One day, as he was chopping wood, his sleeve caught on a branch and tore open. Out spilled the priceless jewel onto the ground before him!

                The source of happiness -- real wealth -- is our birthright, something we carry with us from childhood whether we remember it or not. We are rich, the story says, even when we feel deprived. This is because, of course, the jewel represents the perfect nature of the true, original self with which we are born. Upon finding the jewel, the young man realized he had been rich all along -- and his life changed irreversibly in just that single moment of recognizing the jewel.

                Becoming more aware of the hidden jewel we carry at all times brings us in touch with the source of inner peace and happiness. The more we identify with our hidden treasure, the more we become a well of peace and happiness overflowing into the lives of others.

                This story is a reminder of how easily we fall into "either-or" thinking. It doesn't matter what the subject is, we are fully capable of taking sides and then feeling the need to prove ourselves "right." The lesson of "seeing ourselves seeing" is a necessary one if we are to develop the witness awareness that watches habit thoughts and feelings arise automatically. Interrupting ingrained reactions to things allows us to consciously create new reactions that better reflect our current stage of development.

                n Ayodhya, there was a beautiful white pigeon. A very special kind. That beautiful white pigeon could fly high in the blue sky up from one tree to another tree, from one rooftop to another. Her wings made sounds like Phad... Phad… Phad... and she never seemed to mind because she had faith in her own capacities gifted by God… on her powerful wings!

                The pigeon lived in her nest made on Noore Allah Masjid, made with straws & threads collected from St. Mary’s Church near the Gurudwara.

                The pigeon flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir, and then she flew right back again. Birds have no religions, then why we humans?

                One sad day, when the pigeon flew out, it started to rain. Although she flew with all her might, she couldn’t get home again. She beat her wings against the rain, but they got wet and slowly some feathers drooped from her wings, and shewas injured due to this.

                The pigeon tried her best to fly. But she knew that she was “pooped.”

                A kind 7-year-old girl, Krishna, was watching that troubled pigeon. Krishna was enjoying a bath in the rain that time.

                Krishna saw the poor pigeon fall into her garden. Krishna felt that in that situation her duty was quite simple. She took that tiny frail bird and kept her warm and dry. She gave her water so she could drink, some food to eat and told her, “Not to cry... you will be o.k. soon Mashkalli!”

                Krishna named the pigeon “Mashkalli” because of Mashkalli’s beautiful white colour and eyes like diamonds. Krishna told Mashkalli, “You look like a “Shantidoot… Messenger of Peace & love!”

                Krishna cared for Mashkalli for fifteen days, until Mashkalli became quite strong. Krishna took Mashkalli everywhere she went, to school, to work, and to play. They grew very close during this period.

                One day Krishna watched Mashkalli fearfully. Krishna knew Mashkalli wouldn’t be there long.

                “Please, mummy, may I keep this bird Mashkalli? Now Mashkalli loves me and I love her. We are friends; I just can’t let him go.” Krishna’s voice was sad and low when she requested her mother.

                Krishna’s mother spoke softly and gently. She knew just what to say, “Look Krishna! Mashkalli’s home is somewhere else. Mashkalli’ must soon fly away... our garden has been a resting place for her, just like a small hotel or hospital. Krishna, it is nice of you that you took care of your bird friend Mashkalli. In her troubled time. However, this does not mean that you can keep her in any cage. If you really love someone, let us free them! If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly come back to you someday…!”

                Yes, what Krishna’s mother said was very true. It happened the next day. Mashkalli circled overhead, and then she flew away, as Krishna watched.

                Krishna felt a little sad for a few days because she was missing Mashkalli a lot. However, Krishna had full faith in her mother’s words. “If you really love someone you have to free them. If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly comeback to you someday…!”

                Now Mashkalli was rather home again. She was feeling very happy. Mashkalli again started to flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir.

                Now, “The Messenger of Peace & love: Shantidoot Mashkalli” takes a little longer flight. Mashkalli always stops at Krishna’s garden to tell her friend hello, pay thanks, and play with her every morning.

                If this, an uneducated bird can pay thanks to her helper, why not we, so called educated humans…?”

                In the rising sun’s light of hope, little Krishna was thinking this, and Shantidoot Mashkalli was eating food from Krishna’s little, soft palm, sitting on her hand. Krishna’s mother was watching that special friendship of an innocent human and an innocent bird. She smiled.

                A man woke up in the middle of a dirt road. Half of his face had brown dirt covering it, and his hair was a mess. His shirt was ragged, and he had lost a shoe. His vision was all blurry, and he was squinting in the sunlight, struggling to make use of his eyes. He could see a few hazy trees in the distance, beyond the expanse of dry, yellow land and grass. He had been in an accident. He had fallen from his buggy, banged his head, and had forgotten everything about himself. He had woken up with absolutely no memory of anything whatsoever. He knew he should have some memories, but he could locate none. He became very afraid. Who was he? How had he got here?

                As his vision continued to adjust to his surroundings, he saw a pile of papers on the ground, and a little red booklet resting on the top of them, just a few meters from where he was. He had not noticed, however, that a few meters to the left of this pile of information, was a lion.

                The lion walked gently in front of the papers, creating a barrier between them and the man. Then the lion sat down on his hindquarters, and looked at the man in the eyes.

                The man did not move. He was well aware that it was a lion now.

                "I saw what happened," said the lion, seeing that the man had no idea.

                "You were driving too fast in that thing," the lion nodded towards the buggy further down the dirt road, which was tipped over on its side. "And you fell out. These papers have all your information on them, your name, address – all of your details."

                The man felt like he was frozen to the warm earth beneath him.

                "Oh, and don't worry," added the lion, forgetting how things may have appeared to the man "...I'm not particularly hungry."

                "May I have the papers?" asked the man, wishing to get away with his details as quickly as possible.

                "Yes, of course," said the lion, standing up and ready to remove the blockade he had created.

                "Oh, thank you," said the man, relieved, "I don’t even remember who I am!"

                At this the lion stopped. He sat back down. This was too good to spoil. A man who had no ideas about himself? No psychological baggage at all? No identity to speak of? Oh, how wonderful...

                "Ah, amnesia of the self," said the lion, feeling refreshed. "Beautiful."

                "What do you mean beautiful?" asked the man impatiently, "I need my identity back! I mean...who am I? I know nothing of my past, not even my own name! Please!" he begged, "The papers!"

                "Listen to yourself panicking like this," the lion chuckled. "This is quite silly."

                "But I have absolutely no identity!" cried out the man, pleading for this lion to give him some information about himself.

                "I will give you these papers," said the lion, "but I want you to look at something. At the moment you know nothing about yourself, but you do not deny your own existence. You are begging me to give you your name and personal history, because without these stories you feel you are nothing, no one – that you don’t exist without your identity. But you are still here. Do not confuse your name, history and occupation with who you are. You exist, no matter what your story, what your name. If you were not so desperate for labels and definitions to create an identity for yourself, you would feel so free, so happy, so at one with this creation. Can you not just be comfortable having no definitions for a moment, and really be aware of what you truly are?

                "This is a blessing in disguise,” added the lion.

                This man felt he could not argue with the lion anymore, so he followed his orders. Who was he? This was what he was trying to find out through the information on those papers. But the lion was right, at the moment this man had no ideas about himself, yet somehow, his existence was being fully felt. His existence was present, but now it was no longer connected to any ideas. His existence was not limited to any particular form, it was everywhere, making up everything.

                The lion was now standing, looking at the man, with dark, deep eyes. As the man looked back at the lion, he felt like whatever was looking out of the lion's eyes, was not separate from what was looking out of his own.

                "Now you can have the papers." The lion pushed them with its paw towards the man, and they made a scraping noise on the ground. The man crouched down, picked them up, but now was not so eager to give himself a description. He figured these papers would be useful so he could find his house, get his bearings, but he didn’t need them to know who he was just yet. He placed them in his back pocket, and skipped off towards the hut he could now see in the distance, completely free of the ideas about himself he previously had.

                There abode in Thessaly, in the days of Hercules, a strange race of men who had the head and arms of a man together with the body of a horse. They were called Centaurs, or Bull-Slayers.

                One of them named Cheiron, famous for his knowledge of medicine, music and botany, had been the teacher of Hercules. But many of them, although learned, were not good. Hercules and Theseus had waged war on them and had killed many, so that their numbers were greatly lessened.

                Having married Deianira, the daughter of a powerful King of Calydon, in Greece, Hercules was traveling home with her when he came to the banks of a river and was at a loss how to cross it. Seeing his perplexity, Nessus, one of the Centaurs, offered to take Deianira on his back and carry her over the stream. This offer Hercules gladly accepted.

                No sooner, however, did the crafty Centaur obtain possession of Deianira than he made off with her, intending to have her as his own wife. You can easily imagine how angry this outrage made Hercules. He shot one of his poisoned arrows with so much force that it went right through the traitor Centaur, and wounded him even unto death.

                But, before dying, Nessus had time to tell Deianira that if she wanted to keep Hercules always true to her she had but to take his shirt, and, when her husband's love was waning, prevail on him to wear it.

                Deianira took the shirt, and shortly afterwards, being afraid that her husband was ceasing to love her, she sent it to him as a present.

                Now, you will remember that Hercules had shot through the shirt of Nessus one of his poisoned arrows, and you will not be surprised to hear that some of the poison had remained in the shirt. So when Hercules put it on, which he did immediately upon receiving it, he was seized with frenzy and, in his madness, he uttered terrible cries and did dreadful deeds.

                With his powerful hands he broke off huge pieces of rock, tore up pine-trees by their roots and hurled them with resounding din into the valley.

                He could not take off the fatal shirt, and as he tore off portions of it he tore, at the same time, his quivering flesh.

                The servant of Deianira who had carried him the fatal shirt, and who wished to solace him in his pain, he seized as she approached him and flung headlong into the sea, where she was changed into a rock that long, so runs the legend, kept its human form.

                But at ln the majesty and the courage of the hero asserted themselves, and, although still in agony, his madness left him.

                Calling to his side his friend Philoctetes, he wished to embrace him once more before dying; but fearful lest he should, in so doing, infect his friend with the deadly poison that was consuming him, he cried in his agony: "Alas, I am not even permitted to embrace thee!"

                Then he gathered together the trees he had uprooted and made a huge funeral pyre, such as was used by the ancients in burning their dead. Climbing to the top of the heap, he spread out the skin of the Nemean lion, and, supporting himself upon his club, gave the signal for Philoctetes to kindle the fire that was to reduce him to ashes.

                In return for this service he gave Philoctetes a quiver full of those deadly arrows that had been dipped in the blood of the Hydra of Lerna.

                He further enjoined his friend to let no man know of his departure from life, to the intent that the fear of his approach might prevent fresh monsters and new robbers from ravaging the earth.

                Thus died Hercules, and after his death he was received as a god amongst the Immortals on Mount Olympus, where he married Hebe, Jove's cupbearer. In his honor mortals were commanded to build altars and to raise temples.

                The county recreation center swimming pool where one gets such badges presents very different conditions to those created when a June storm dumped six inches of rain over Columbia in Missouri with little warning—causing floodwaters from creeks to burst their banks, causing overflow zones to turn into ponds.

                When 15-year-old Dominic Viet and 16-year-old Joseph Diener passed a basketball court that had turned essentially into a water polo area, they heard the frantic shouting of a young woman desperately trying to keep her head above water under the force of a current.

                The boys had seen the girl swimming with a friend there before, but it was now obvious she was drowning.

                “The first thing that came into my mind was to get into the water,” Dominic told CNN. “We didn’t have time to think, her head was barely above the water and we could see her sinking more down every second. We didn’t think about the risks, we had to get her out.”

                Heroes will do as heroes do, and hoisting her up onto their shoulders, Dom and Joseph got her ashore, where emergency services arriving at someone else’s call performed first aid and rushed her to the hospital.

                Floodwaters are no conditions to be swimming in. There can be sewage runoff, loose chemicals, downed power lines charging the current with electricity, or physical debris such as manhole covers that have been lifted out of their sockets by the force of the water.

                Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Jenkins described the boys’ act as heroic and brave, as did Dominic’s mom, who had been calling her son for some time before and was growing nervous.

                She sent her husband, Dom’s father, to check on his position, but when he arrived he saw ambulances and firetrucks from the call that was meant to rescue the young woman.

                “I thought of the worst, he’s on a bike and people weren’t paying attention and my fear was he was going to pull up and see our son on the ground,” said Mrs. Viet. “But then he saw them on their bikes heading back to their friend’s house, and I got a text from Dominic saying ‘Coming home soon, just saved a woman’s life Mom.'”

                Oh Mom… how about you have a little faith?

                The fire department will honor the two boys with a “Citizen Life Safety Award” next week.

                Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant acted with bravery that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest honor.

                On Friday, Ralph Puckett, Jr. was hosted at the White House where he received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. government’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.

                Ralph’s first response was to ask, “Why all the fuss? Can’t they just mail it to me?”

                But, after his lifetime of service to the nation, President Joe Biden said at the medal ceremony, “Rather than mail it to you, I would’ve walked it to you.”

                Ralph’s wife of 68 years, Jeannie Puckett, was in the audience, too, as Biden described how the couple met—while the brave Army Ranger was recovering from his wounds.

                They were married two years to the day after the battle in November, 1950, for which he was honored this week with the following citation: “For acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the commander 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company…”

                51 of Puckett’s Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out in a daylight attack to take Hill 205, just 60 miles from the border with China, which drew mortar, machine gun, and small-arms fire against them. First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in their offensive.

                To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire.

                “Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position, with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” continued the citation.

                When the Rangers finally reached the top of the hill, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn’t nearly over.

                “During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett.”

                Even though Puckett’s Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one, five attacks by a battalion-strength enemy were repulsed.

                During the first wave, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support. Over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.

                “He repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole, to check the company’s perimeter and to distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers.”

                Extraordinary selflessness above and beyond the call
                When the enemy launched a sixth attack, two mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting “grievous wounds” in both his feet, his backside, his left arm and shoulder.

                “Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy.

                Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy-controlled hill.

                First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

                First Time a Foreign Leader Attended This Ceremony
                Biden said in his remarks, “Korea is sometimes called the “Forgotten War.” But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett’s command — they’ll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.”

                “And the people of the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the President of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before.”

                President Moon said, “I learned that I’m the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.

                “Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean War… Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea.”

                “From the ashes of the Korean War, we rose, we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea’s peace and freedom. And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.”

                Puckett’s military service did not end in the Korean War. He also served in the Vietnam War, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars, adding to his five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.

                Visionaries are often accused of being a little mad. Even by their wives. Such was the case of Laungi, a resident of India’s drought-blighted Gaya district in the eastern state of Bihar.

                Loungi Bhuiya had become increasingly distraught as more and more farmers—including four of his own sons—left Kolithwa for greener pastures. Taking a leaf from Don Quixote, Bhuiyan was determined not only to dream an impossible dream but to make that dream come true by single-handedly bringing water to his village in hopes of transforming the barren land into arable acreage.

                Inspired by the earlier exploits of “Mountain Man” Dashrath Manjh, who, with just a hammer and chisel, spent 22 years carving a road through the mountain near the village Gehlaur from 1960 to 1982, Bhuiya set out to dig an irrigation canal by hand to the closest water source in the Bangetha Hills.

                “I had heard about him and I thought if he can do it, why can’t I?” Bhuiya told Al Jazeera. “They all thought I was mad.”

                “He decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village,” Village leader Vishnupat Bhokta told the Tribune of India.

                “The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”

                Despite the teasing from his family and fellow villagers, the now 70-year-old Bhuiya toiled every day to make the four-foot-wide by three-foot-deep canal a reality. It took him nearly 30 years to accomplish his goal, but now everyone is benefitting from the fruits of his decades’ long labors.

                Bhuiya, whose reputation as a neighborhood eccentric has since been transformed into local hero, was recently rewarded for his efforts with a brand-new Mahindra tractor, which will be used to expand the canal.

                Of course, when Quixote creator Miguel de Cervantes wrote: “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical may be madness. To surrender dreams, this may be madness… Maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be,” he wasn’t referring to Bhuiya—but he just as well might have been.

Listen, I was in the Marines, and even though that was 40-some years ago, I still think like a Marine; fortunately, I still react like one once in a while. She leveled out flat as she hit my arms, and bounced off me and fell about four feet away. I fell to the ground, too, from the impact, and I blacked out for a minute. When I came to, Glenn was holding up fingers and saying, “How many do you see?” I was OK. The woman was alive but was in a coma for a while and had brain surgery.

It’s a bear!” I opened my front door, and there was a 275-pound polar bear sitting on its haunches with a woman in its mouth, waving her around like a rag doll. I thought to myself, I’ve got no weapon or anything. Then I saw my shovel sitting there and found myself going to get it. Once I picked it up, I thought, Well, am I going to do anything, or is that woman going to die? So down the steps I went. 
                When I got over there, I stepped up and hit the bear in the eye. I’d heard this is the best way to fight a bear. He let go of the woman, and she ran into my house. The bear reached out and grabbed ahold of me, and the mauling was on. He tore off my right ear, and I was waiting for him to bite me again. A neighbor fired a shotgun, but it didn’t do any good, so he jumped into his truck and gunned it toward us. I was on my belly on the ground, watching this vehicle speeding our way, and it stopped about two feet away before the bear let me go.

                I spent seven days in the hospital. They worked on me for four hours one day, to staple my wounds, and then for four hours the next day, putting my ear back on. So I came out of it pretty good.

                The crash woke me up. Just after midnight, on a very windy Sunday last October, I heard a very loud noise, and it was a large fir tree falling into my yard from the neighbor’s yard. It crushed a greenhouse and took down the tip of a power line as it landed. I’ve been in my house almost 50 years and know how much damage wind and trees can do, but as I was coming downstairs and glanced outside, I was horrified to see brilliant flames outside my window, way up over my head.

                I live alone­ — my husband died six years ago — and I thought, I have to call 911. But there was no time. I thought, This could go everywhere. It could burn the whole hill. I threw on something over my nightgown, raced outside, grabbed a hose and started spraying water as hard as I could. The wind had already spread the flames to a live oak and then to some blackberry vines on the edge of my driveway. It was really howling now, and I could feel the heat, but I just braced myself and kept on squirting.

Then the couple across the driveway came, and someone called the fire department. When the fire trucks arrived, they yelled at us to move back, but I couldn’t stop. I said, “We have to keep water on this fire.”

                I had no idea I had done anything special. People I never met were knocking on my front door the next day, saying, “You’re a hero. You saved the hill.” But I was just the first responder. I saw what I saw, and I took action.

                Thousands of people lost everything that night in other parts of California. We were fortunate to be spared. But I don’t think it was a miracle. The reality is, my children weren’t there and my husband wasn’t there, and if I wanted to stay in the home I loved, I would have to step up. So I did — but then got a lot of help.

                Once upon a time 10 years ago I had my 15th birthday. My mum woke me up this marvelous morning and told me I had a special delivery at the front door. I dressed myself and ran down the stairs in excitement. When I opened the front door to my surprise I found a big box in the middle of the door way. I jumped in joy and ran inside to see my aunties, uncles, brothers, cousins, grandparents and the rest of my family that were already awake.Everyone wanted me to open the box already but I waited till I put it on the table. Oh my goodness I was about to open it when I heard a noise coming from the box. IT WAS A KITTEN AND A PUPPY. I quickly opened it and found an adorable kitten who was all black with ginger and white patches on her. I named her Precious. Aw how cute was she. After that I carefully took my puppy out of the box and held him. He was a little tiny black and white dog with a few patches on him. I chose to name him terror because he tore the box open before I got him out. My family told me that I got my puppy Terror from my male relatives and I got the kitten Precious from my female relatives. The afternoon was here already and I had turned 15 at 12:13PM. My friends came over to celebrate my birthday. When they all got here to my surprise I had found a huge gift from all of them. I opened this card up and found airfares to Sydney and to go to Palm Beach to meet my inspirations, the cast of home and away. " OH MY GOODNESS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY EVER I CAN'T BELIEVE IT" We all went out and had an amazing time. That isn't all you get Jessica. " We are all going out tomorrow before you leave to Sydney with all of your family. "WHAT YOU MEAN I AM LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT WITH MY FAMILY TO GO ON AN AEROPLANE"? "YEP YOU GOT IT RIGHT GIRL". "SEE THIS IS LEGIT THE BEST DAY EVER"I exclaimed. "WE HAVE ALSO GOT YOU TICKETS TO MEET AND GREET ONE DIRECTION AND YOU WILL BE STAYING IN THE SAME HOTEL AS THEM". "WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "I LOVE YOU GIRLS SO MUCH YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME". "Well girly you and your family better start packing because you leave tomorrow night and we are all going out tomorrow to celebrate your 15th". "Alright"! Guess what Jessica. "What"? "That isn't it we haven't told you another surprise. "WHAT IS IT"? "WE ARE COMING TO Sydney ASWELL AS YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF. SO IS TERROR AND PRECIOUS"? "AHHHHHHHH ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "YEP WHY WOULDN'T WE BE"? "WHERE IS PRECIOUS AND TERROR GOING TO STAY"? "WITH YOU". "TERROR AND PRECIOUS ARE STAYING WITH YOU AND WE FLY OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON JETSTAR JQ1314 AT 9:00PM."WHEN WE GET TO SYDNEY EVERYONE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT AND EVERYTHING". The day came and I was super excited. at about 10:30PM we arrived at Sydney airport and it felt so good to be in my favorite place. I mean this was the best birthday ever that I will never ever ever ever forget in a whole life time. Jetstar was an amazing flight and we had the best time ever.

                Life is full of unexpected surprises. There are many opportunities when one can secretly wish for something exciting to happen – something out of the ordinary. The real surprise is when the wish unexpectedly comes true. I never believed that something like this could ever happen to me; such a thing that would make me stop and look back at the events in awe. I think you would agree that something as simple as being lost in the forest for less than ten minutes should have no influence on my life. If you do agree, that makes both of us wrong.

                Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Coote’s Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

                As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. That’s when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that can’t be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

                I think that another reason that I felt carefree was because my parents didn’t panic. They took the situation under control and headed for any open area in hopes to find a map (many of these maps were found throughout the grounds, telling you where you were). From my point of view, at the time, it seemed as if they were excited as I was about losing our way. In the end, it only took my parents ten minutes to find such a map and we were back on the trail in no time.

                An experience like this made me think about my place in life. I’m the type who loves seeking out adventures. When we were lost, I realized that I had everything I would ever need with me – my family. They’ve always supported me in everything I do. This experience made me realize that families need to stick together; you don’t realize how much you need them until, for a moment, you think they’ll be the last people you see for the rest of your life.

                It’s incredible how much a simple thing like being lost in a forest for ten minutes will affect your outlook on life. Things like not being able to find your way back to where you came from make you appreciate the little things in life. Looking back on the day, I realize now that it was fate. Moments like that are few and far between and should be taken as a lesson. Surprises like this were, and always will be, an unexpected gift for all.

                I was full of excitement and very queer to see the new born baby next door. My Mom told that our neighbour, Shanti Bhabhi had given birth to a little fairy, the lakshmi of the home, a baby girl. But suddenly this happiness curve on my face disappeared with the thought of her husband. Shanti's husband, Raju bhaiya who was not a good man. A drunkard by nature, he had never provided that space to his wife and his male chauvinism was fiercely aggressive. I once heard his words in the street to the little daughter of our neighbours that studying and playing doesn't suit girls. They are meant for bangles and making rotis, just like a common male chauvinist. The prevailing awareness of the maltreatment of girls in the media, shook me again. I just wished that this liitle fairy should not face such a treatment and should be brought up on an equality basis with the sons of the same house. But somewhere in the heart the thought took place so firmly that I went to Shanti Bhabhi's house and what I saw next was unbelievable. I saw Raju Bhaiya with his little daughter in his hands and saying that he wished to grew his daughter with all the best education that he can afford. The love and incredibility of the moment rolled down tears from my eyes. I got back to my home relaxing that really the little fairy has brought happiness and a positive change along with a pleasant surprise.

                After a long bout with Parkinson’s, my Grandmother had passed. And as a pleasant surprise, I was in the will. I had inherited her car, and the ghost that came in the car. That’s right. Grandma’s car was haunted. Her 1980 Chevy Citation was haunted.

                I was surprised in so many ways. Hell, when I first turned the key I didn’t think that the thing would even start, let alone be haunted. It was an aged hunk of junk, and hadn’t seen much use in the past twenty years. And then when I saw the little figure creeping along the dash, I started to wonder if this was why she chose to stop driving it; and not because of the glaucoma.

                I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find something that wasn’t static, when it came. It was tiny, the size of my hand. It was the classic ghost. Literally, the classic ghost. In a little white sheet (a handkerchief, really) with tiny holes where the eyes and mouth would be. I couldn’t see any feet beneath the hem of the shroud, but it seemed to have tiny little hands poking up as it levitated towards me. And as it came drifting along, it was making a little ethereal ‘whooooooo’ sound at me.

                It was freaking adorable.

                I mean, come on. It was like a kindergarten Halloween decoration had come to life and came to visit. It was so little! It was smaller than the rat I had when I was in college. It was smaller than my breakfast sandwich. I wanted to pet it.

                I suppose in retrospect, yeah. I should have been a little more respectful. Maybe taken it a little bit more seriously. Seeing visible proof of the afterlife, actual confirmation of existence after death… well, that’s serious stuff. And, one would think, deserved more respect than the delirious giggles I wasn’t holding back.

                I think even the little ghost was actually taken aback by this. It stopped mid-‘whoo’ and kind of stared at me. It just drifted in place, bobbing like a floater in the corner of your eye.

                And there I sat, snickering and crouched back against the driver’s side door of the old Citation. The car still smelled like Vicks and old menthol cigarettes, the defining scents of my dear old Grandma.

                Was this Grandpa, maybe? Could it be? My mind raced. Grandma never spoke much of her ex-husband, just that he was a son of a bitch and that he had gotten his ‘just desserts’. Did his ‘just desserts’ involve being murdered and cursed to haunt a handkerchief on his jilted wife’s dashboard? But then I remembered mom saying that her dad had just jumped ship and moved to Iowa, where he had died in 1979.

                So my theory was obviously sunk. I peered at the little thing, static from the dusty old radio an idle buzz in the back of my mind. The ghost just bobbed in the warm air beneath the windshield, occasionally emitting little ‘Whooo’s!’ at me. I didn’t think it was trying to scare me anymore.

                Then a much more troubling idea occurred to me. What if this thing was my grandmother? Oh, now that’s a terrible thought. I couldn’t think of a worse fate than being doomed to spend the rest of eternity haunting the interior of a mid-80’s compact.

                And worse, if this was my Grandma’s spirit then I’d feel especially guilty taking the Citation to the junkyard to sell for parts.

                I had to know. I sat in thought for a moment, then came to a resolution. I was going to see exactly who — or what — this thing really was. I sat up in the drivers seat, steeled myself. I reached out towards the little ghost with my fingers trembling.

                I won’t lie to you, I was terrified. At first I thought the whole thing was kind of funny, this little cutesy ghost the size of half a donut. But the prospect of what could be under that little white sheet, that scared the hell out of me. I didn’t want to see my undead Grandma, pale and shrunken and horribly shriveled after death. I wanted Grandma to be in heaven with Great-Uncle Al, and all of her dogs, and her one cat that I had liked.

                As I slowly reached out my shaking hand, it actually reached out to me a little bit. I was startled, and snatched my hand back a little bit. But I focused, and mentally pushed my hand forward again. I had to know.

                I yanked up the little white sheet with my eyes shut tight, and after a second I slowly eased them open so that I could see who — what — it was.

                I didn’t know the guy.

                I ended up making four hundred bucks at the junkyard. Which was another pleasant surprise

                I had got the money by work done at home, out of office hours. It came to four pounds altogether. At first I thought I would use it to discharge a part of our debt to Eliza’s mother. But it was very possible that she would send it back again, in which case the pence spent on the postal orders would be wasted, and I am not a man that wastes pennies. Also, it was not absolutely certain that she would send it back. I sent her a long letter instead–my long letters are almost her only intellectual pleasure. As for the four pounds, I reserved two for myself, for any incidental expenses, and decided to give two to Eliza. I did not mean simply to hand them to her, but to get up something in the way of a pleasant surprise.

                I had tried something of the kind before. Eliza once asked me for six shillings for a new tea-tray that she had seen. I went and stood behind her chair, and said, “No, dear, I couldn’t think of it,” at the same time dropping the six shillings down the back of her neck. Eliza said it was a pity I couldn’t give her six shillings for a tea-tray without compelling her to go up-stairs and undress at nine o’clock in the morning. It was not a success.

                However, I had more than one idea in my head. This time I thought I would first find out if there was anything she wanted.

                So on Sunday at tea-time I said, not as if I were meaning anything in particular, “Is there anything you want, Eliza?”

                “Yes,” she said; “I want a general who’ll go to bed at half-past nine and get up at half-past five. If they’d only do that, that’s all I ask.”

                “You will pardon me, Eliza,” I said, “but you are not speaking correctly. You said that was all that you asked. What you meant—-“

                “Do you know what I meant?”

                “I flatter myself that I know precisely—-“

                “Then if you know precisely what I meant, I must have spoken accurately.”

                But as we went to church I discovered that she wanted a new jacket. Her own was trimmed rabbit, and had been good, but the fur had gone bald in places.

                * * * * *

                Next morning I wrote on a sheet of note-paper, “To buy a new jacket. With your husband’s love.” I folded the two sovereigns up in this, and dropped the packet into the pocket of Eliza’s old jacket, as it hung in the wardrobe, not telling her what I had done. My idea was that she would put on the jacket to go out shopping in the morning, and putting her hand in the pocket, get a pleasant surprise. As I was leaving for town, she asked me why I kept on smiling so mysteriously. I replied, “Perhaps you, too, will smile before the day is over.”

                On my return I found Eliza at the front door. “Come and look,” she said, cheerfully. “I have got a pleasant surprise for you.” She flung open the drawing-room door, and pointed. In the middle of the table stood a spiraea, a most handsome and graceful plant. It stood in one of the best saucers, with some coloured paper round the pot, and the general effect was very good. I at once guessed that she had bought it for me with the change from my present to her, and thought it showed very good feeling in her.

                “I hope you have not given too much for this,” I said.

                “I didn’t give any money for it.”

                “I don’t understand.”

                “Well, you must know I had a present this morning.”

                “Of course I know.”

                “Did mother tell you? Yes, she has sent me a beautiful new jacket. Then a man came round with a barrow of plants, and he said he didn’t want money if I had any clothes to spare. So I gave him my old worn-out jacket for this spiraea, and—-“
                I remembered that I had seen the man with the barrow farther down the street.

                “Excuse me for one moment, Eliza,” I said, and dashed out after him.

                * * * * *

                He was a big, red-faced man, and he made no difficulty about it at all.

                “Yes,” he said, “I bought that jacket, gov’ner, and I don’t deny it. There it is at the bottom of my bundle, and I ain’t even looked at it since. Nor I ain’t goin’ to look now. You say there was two suvreigns in the pocket. A gent like you don’t want to swindle a common man like me. If you say the two suvreigns was there, then they’re there now, and I can return yer two pound out o’ my own, in a suttunty of gettin’ ’em back out o’ the jacket pocket. Bless yer! I knows an honest man when I sees one.”

                With these words he drew the money from his own waistcoat pocket, and handed it to me. I took it with some reluctance.

                “Hadn’t you better make quite certain—-“

                “Not a bit,” says he. “If them suvreigns were there when the jacket were ‘anded to me, they is there now. I could see as you was a man to be trusted, otherwise I’d ‘ave undone the bundle and searched long afore this.”

                * * * * *

                “What have you been doing?” said Eliza, on my return.

                “Never mind. Your mother has given you a new jacket. Let me have the pleasure of giving you a new hat.” I pressed the two coins into her palm.

                She looked at them, and said, “You can’t get a hat for a halfpenny, you know, dear. What did you rush out for just now? And why did you have these two farthings gilded? You’ll be mistaking them for sovereigns, if you’re not careful. Were you trying to take me in?”

                I did not quite see what to say for the moment, and so I took her suggestion. I explained that it was a joke.

                “You don’t look much as if you were joking.”

                “But I was. I suppose I ought to know if any man does. However, Eliza, if you want a new hat, anything up to half a sovereign, you’ve only to say it.”

                She said it, thanked me, and asked me to come and help her water the spiraea.

                “It’s such a shapely spiraea,” she said.

                “Yes,” I answered sadly, “it’s a regular plant.” And so it was, though I had not been intending what the French call a double entendre at the time

                “Surprises are beautiful because they come without waiting.” Not so true for Nancy though. She was sure her sister was planning a surprise for her birthday. Pulling open the pink pastel curtains of her bedroom window,  she hungrily drank in the fresh morning air. Her eyes were laced with longing. A soft smile slid across her lips which were otherwise dry with sadness and coated with grief.  Nancy was turning 30 today. “Keep calm. It’s only your 30th birthday”. Humming her favourite song in her head, her lips pursed in, Nancy ran her fingers over her thin wavy short hair. No a strand of grey! Many of her friends were already showing mini zebra stripes in their heads. But, not her! Thank goodness for that.

                She quickly glanced at the mirror and looked away. She never liked looking at the mirror. It always reminded her of what she was not. “Life is just a mirror and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you.” Wally “famous” Amos. Turning her face away from the mirror like it was an enemy on the prowl, a single glossy tear flowed down her cheek. Clutching the ends of her dress, she poured them back in again. She was not going to think of the past and all that it had done to her. She held her palms up and looked at them. Shrivelled walnuts were what they looked like. Lifeless, yet useful. “Nothing worth having, comes easy.”

                All these years she had worked at different factories, clothes, metals, chemicals, shoe, scrubbed the floors at big hotels where perfumed men and women floated easily.  Ever since their parents died, her only goal was to educate Kate, her younger sister. Her emotions came running back to the present. Quickly, she wiped her dried tears and rushed some chirpy cheer on her face. She paced to the door and back.

                “A sister is a little bit of childhood that can never be lost.” Kate was her dream, her hope, her happiness. The gleam of a thousand stars shone on her face as she thought of her sister. Her precious possession. She meant everything to her. She was all she had. Kate shined liked a diamond in a heap of coal. She was an outstanding student and an obedient younger sister. And today, Nancy was sure Kate would surprise her like she did every year. Nancy’s nostrils swelled open in anticipation of the sweet aroma of the freshly baked chocolate cake that would welcome her. Her tongue was eager to lick up the soft, brown cream and her teeth were ready to bite into Kate’s inviting delicacy. She stretched her ears with her hands to hear the sound of Kate’s footsteps coming towards her. She clapped her hands and giggled at her own act of childishness.
                She waited and waited.

                It seemed like an endless wait and a tide of emotions were rushing through Nancy. Finally, she heard her younger sister approaching her room. Her eyes lit up, her steps turned into a spring and her heart grew all  bouncy. She sniffed the air to catch a whiff of the chocolate cake but it was missing. Maybe it was not chocolate flavour this time, she imagined with pride intruding her thoughts. Her sister was all grown up now. She could surprise her with something else.

                Kate walked into her room empty handed. No cake, no flowers, no package wrapped in shiny golden paper, tied with red ribbons. The excitement dissolved from Nancy’s face. Her face looked like a blank, crumpled, white page. Kate was smiling. She could win the world with the radiance of her smile. She gave her sister a tight hug. “Happy birthday” said Kate. Nancy loosened herself from the warm embrace and looked at her sister. “Thank you” she said, smiling coldly. “And here’s your gift” Kate handed her a brown envelope. Nancy’s eyebrows shot up like mountain peaks and her eyes were flooded with questions.

                “Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love is by far the truest type of love. This is your admission letter to the community college. I want you to pick up from where you left.”

                Nancy’s eyes grew moist and her trembling hands were silenced by Kate’s firm grip over them. Nancy shut her eyes tight and let her tears flow as she folded her hands in prayer. Kate’s words sparkled with happiness and shined with guilt as she said “You deserve much more my dear sister, but this is all I can give you.”

I visualised and wished that I would get some big surprise as a birthday gift from the Universe and then I completely forgot about it. But just 15 days before my birthday I was diagnosed with Typhoid. On the day of my birthday I was very weak, bedridden and taking my pills and eating only boiled food. I was unable to talk over the phone so no one called me and my family thought it was not appropriate to bring me cake as I was unable to eat it. It was my birthday evening and I was at home feeling dull.

                The Universe never forgets your wish, and it did not forget mine either, so then it happened. All my friends came over to my place and gave me a big birthday surprise! They brought the cake and a gift which was a branded Jacket, which was also one of my wishes. I had an awesome time with them and felt so happy.

                Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no questions....just a black dot in the center of the page.

                After all had been read, the classroom silent, the professor began to explain: "I am not going to grade you on this; I just wanted to give you something to think about. No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.
                
                Our life is a gift given to us by God, with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature renewing itself everyday, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see everyday.
                
                However we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on.
                
                The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life. Enjoy each one of your blessings, each moment that life gives you. Be happy and live a life filled with LOVE,"

                Liz was just about finished wrapping up the final details for the
                surprise party she was planning for her husband. She had
                been meticulously preparing for this event, designing every aspect
                of the party from the invitations to the food, and she was very excited
                about it.
                Family members whom Guermo hadn’t seen in years were flying in from Peru in
                a few days. Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
                from various places across the country. The caterer and band were set.
                The best part for Liz: she knew Guermo did not have a clue about the party. She
                could not wait to see the look on his face when he walked into a big “Surprise!” in
                his own home.
                The party was to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about picking
                relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to their hotel, Guermo
                walked into the kitchen and said, quite certainly, “Sweetheart, I don’t want
                anything special done for my birthday.”
                “What do you mean?” Liz responded nonchalantly, though her heart began to
                pound.
                “I mean that I don’t want a surprise party.”
                “Okay,” Liz said with a shrug. “Not a problem.”
                Liz’s mind raced. There was nothing she could do about Guermo’s request now.
                And, frankly, she didn’t want to. Liz had been planning this for more than a year.
                The party would go off as she intended. She did not want all of her effort to be for
                naught.
                When Guermo came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends,
                he was shocked. Tears filled his eyes. (This response was something Liz had not
                predicted.) Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in nearly 20
                years and family members who had come from Peru just for this evening.
                But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry with his wife. He
                felt ambushed. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like people to
                see him that way. That was why he did not like being surprised.
                Salsa music filled the home of Liz and Guermo. Guests filled up on ceviche, lomo
                soltado and empanadas. Liz whispered “I love you” in Guermo’s ear, they shared
                a kiss, and the two danced the night away.

                Once upon a time a plump old woman name Tante Adela lived in French Canada.  She lived all alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

                One morning she got up very early as it baking day and there was much to do.  She took a load of wood outside to her oven. 

                “Now why would oven door be open?” she said.  She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in.  But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

                The old woman bent over to look in.  When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut. She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

                When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

                At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw the neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

                “Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick!  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Felix.  “Maybe it is your cat.”

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

                “I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

                Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road.  She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross.  After all, three heads are better than two.

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down its back?”

                “Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath.  “Come right away!  There is a skunk in my oven.”

                “A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

                “Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela.  “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

                “You have a point,” said Louis Ross.  “I will come over as soon as I have finished feeding the chickens.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out.  “You must come to my farm.  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Samuel.  “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela.  “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snark?  I don’t think so!”

                “I will come right over,” said Samuel.  “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

                So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help.  By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there.  Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

                “Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

                “I know that!” said Tante Adela.  “The question is, what to do about it?”

                “I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “She will not be able to bake bread in there for a month!” said Madame Roy, and everyone agreed.

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “And it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel.  He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

                “What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross.  “A dog will bark.  Maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

                “If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

                “What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” said someone else.  “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                So this plan was dropped.  No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers.

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                “Oh, woe is me!” wailed Tante Adela. 

                By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk.  And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come.  Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows.  Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn.  And one by one, everyone found a reason to head home.

                At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard.  The young man may be simple-minded, she thought.  Still, who else could she turn to for help?

                “Jules!” she said.  “Jules Martel.  There is a skunk in my oven.  Can you get him out without scaring him?”
                stop
                What would you do to try and get the skunk out of the oven?

                Jules nodded his head.  He walked over to the oven.  He opened the door and leaned inside.  He spoke in a low voice.  No one could tell what he was saying.  At last he stepped back.  Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway.  Everyone stepped back a few feet.  The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground.

                Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high.  And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “How did you get him to come out?” said Samuel to Jules.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “What DID you say to it?” said someone else.

                “I just told him,” said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, “that if he stayed in the oven any more, he would begin to smell like Tante Adela’s bread.  And if that happened, none of the other skunks would come near him.”

                “Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “That a low creature like a skunk cares about what others creatures like him think of him.”

                “I suppose all creatures must have some sense of self-respect,” said Alice Roy, “no matter who they are.”  Alice Roy and the others nodded in silence

                In just three days, it will be Christmas. Despite the bright and cheery decorations twinkling in the streets, wreaths on doors, and Christmas trees peeking through windows, Hector doesn't feel one drop of joy or excitement. The magic of Christmas seems to have evaporated this year. People passing one another on the street do not wish each other Happy Holidays, smile, or even make eye contact. They simply rush by with their heads down and eyes straight ahead, their minds preoccupied with their to-do lists and avoiding human interaction. 

                Hector doesn't even feel Christmas Spirit from his own family. This morning, he woke up excited to decorate the family Christmas tree with his mother as they did every year. They had barely started wrapping the lights when the phone rang. "Oh dear, it's Aunt Susan!" Hector's mother exclaimed. "Go on without me. I’ll be back." Hector finished the whole tree by himself by the time his mother was off of the phone with her sister. Later that afternoon, Hector's father cancelled their plans to play basketball together. Even Hector's older brother, Yohan, was too busy playing video games to help Hector make shortbread cookies for the family. 

                Feeling discouraged by the lack of festivity around the village and his home, Hector snuggles up with his most comfortable blanket and lets out an enormous sigh. He turns off the light and falls asleep. 

                That night Hector's Native American grandmother, Tallulah, pays him a visit in his dream. Around eight months ago, she left Hector's family to join the great white falcon in the sky. In her gentle voice, she whispers: “Hector, it's up to you to reinvent the magic of Christmas. You can change things. Search in your heart and you’ll find the solution.”

                When he wakes up, Hector cannot stop thinking about his dream. “Reinvent the magic of Christmas,” Tallulah said. He thinks about her words and jots down ideas on a sheet of paper, but crosses them out one by one. Suddenly, his face lights up.

                After lunch, Hector hangs a “do not disturb” sign on the door of his bedroom, closes the curtains, and sits down in his laboratory. This little corner of his room is equipped with a big lamp, magnifying glass, and all the materials from the chemistry set his parents got him for his birthday.

                All afternoon, Hector experiments with various combinations of Christmas ingredients. He melts candy canes and spices into little bowls, then mixes them with some of the plant oils that his grandmother Tallulah handed down to him. The liquid smells pepper-minty and delicious, and Hector feels a rush of optimism. Perhaps this is it! He takes the bowl in his hand and offers a sniff to Zephir, his big striped cat. Zephir's first sniff sends him into a spiral of sneezes. He sniffs the potion once more, then lies down on his back with his feet directly in the air. Hmmmm. Must need some work, thinks Hector. He adjusts the quantities, replaces some of the peppermint with other Christmas ingredients. He looks at Zephir and lets out a joyful shout. 

                Licorice, chocolate chips, cinnamon, star anise powder, three drops of Ayahuasca, a drop of the small seed of Nahele, and two drops of moonflower. He discovered the Christmas Spirit elixir formula!

                Using colored paper from his mother’s desk, Hector cuts, folds, and glues. He makes thirty red, green, blue, yellow, and purple envelopes into which he carefully applies two drops of Christmas Spirit elixir. On each card, he places a sticker of a little elf with a sentence written in capital letters.

                The next day after lunch, Hector gets on his bike. Along each street in the village, he slips a colored envelope under the door of the first house on both the left and right side of every street. Once he finishes all his rounds, Hector returns home. He sits down on his bed and waits. When it's 5 o’clock, he tip-toes downstairs, checks to make sure that no one is looking, then quietly opens the front door and slips outside. Then Hector then walks back into the house, pretending to have just returned home and discovered the little red letter. “Mom, Dad, Yohan, come quick!” He calls. 

                When all four of them are standing together in the living room, Hector reads the label aloud. “Open this letter as a family. After opening me, you should close me again and slip me under the door of the neighbor to your right.”

                The family bubbles with curiosity. Hector's mother grabs the envelope and opens it. A strong scent of chocolate, spice, and incense floats across the living room. Hector's parents and brother stand completely still as the delicious scent surrounds them. Suddenly they begin to move, their eyes sparkling, large smiles slowing spreading across their faces. Hector's father begins to dance, grabbing Hector's mother's hand and twirling her to music only they can hear. They both hum and looking lovingly into one another's eyes. Yohan grabs Hector and lifts him above his head, then begins to spin him around as he used to do when Hector was little. 

                “How about we take the scooters to go look at some Christmas decorations around town?” Hector's mother blurts out, smiling from ear to ear. 

                The family bundles themselves in hats and scarves and coats and rush outside. His brother takes the red scooter, and his father the blue one.

                “Come on, princess, get into my carriage.” Hector's father says to Hector's mother. 

                “Wait!” his mother says. She runs back into the house and grabs the red envelope. When she comes out into the cold again, her husband and two sons are circling around on their scooters. 

                Hector's mother runs across the lawn and stuffs the letter underneath the neighbor's door. She rings doorbell three times and shouts, “Merry Christmas!”

                Then all four of them speed down the street, Hector holding on to his big brother's waist and Hector's mother holding onto Hector's father. Both scooters slide over a large patch of ice, then shoot quickly into a pile of snow. Hector's parents roar with laughter. Hector holds his brother tight.

                Everywhere they go, the village is topsy-turvy. Hector chuckles to himself. His elixir is working! Mrs. Gari and Mrs. Dubois have finally stopped arguing and are building a snowman together, their cheeks rosy with laughter.  The mailman has switched out his black coat for a bright red one. His mailbag filled with candy, and he shouts "Merry Christmas!" as he slings sweet treats out to everyone he passes. On Lilas Street, the family joins an enormous snowball fight. Grown-ups and children alike launch snowballs at one another. Everyone is dodging, jumping, laughing and rolling. On Cerfs Street, a group is playing hide-and-seek among the piles of snow they were once preoccupied with removing from their walkways. Others are sledding, and others are blowing up balloons and releasing them into the chilly afternoon air. Delicious aromas of hot chestnuts, crepes, and nougat float throughout the village. At the large church down the hill, the carousel is all lit up and spinning around. Mostly adults are on it and bob up and down to the happy sound of the music. Hector's father and mother rush over to the merry-go-round. Hector spots his teacher on the ride, sitting in a big fire truck. Hector waves to him with a huge smile.

                His brother walks towards him holding two huge servings of cotton candy. They both sit down on the bench across from the dazzling Christmas tree. While enjoying his treat, Hector smiles. In all the eyes that meet his, there is that little spark that shines, a little spark of happiness that tastes like childhood. “Thank you, Tallulah,” he whispers quietly.

                Today is Ruby’s eighth birthday. Ruby does not know that her parents have arranged a circus party at her grandparents' house. Many of Ruby’s friends are invited to the party. Her little brother John helped his mum make the cake and the cupcakes.

                When Ruby woke up, she yawned. “It’s my birthday today,” she said. She ran down from her room into the kitchen. When Ruby’s mum heard her she hid the cake and the cupcakes. “Happy Birthday Ruby, we are going to take you to a surprise outing today.” “Yes!” Ruby cried, she was so excited.

                Ruby ran to her room and put on her gold sparkly dress, her gold sparkly shoes and a gold headband. She wore her favourite butterfly necklace. It was then time to go.

                Ruby hopped into the car and was amazed as there were balloons and streamers, and her seat was decorated in gold sparkles like a throne. Ruby wondered where her mum, dad and brother were taking her. As she looked outside the window she saw a beautiful rainbow in the bright blue sky, twinkling through the branches. “Hang on a minute,” Ruby said when the car stopped. "We are at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.” Grandma and Grandpa greeted Ruby outside the house. “Happy Birthday Ruby, please come inside,” they said.

                As Ruby walked inside the house she saw steamers and balloons everywhere. Ruby then walked into the backyard and was startled when she saw a big red tent with blue and yellow spots. “What is that? Oh my goodness, it’s a circus,” she cried. She walked into the tent and gasped as she saw many of her school friends. She saw Abigail, Amelia, Ella, Zara, Holly, Hannah, Abby, Elie, Cameron, Monique, Amy, Stephanie, Olivia, Maddison, Brianna, Isabella and her bestfriend Grace. They were all so excited to see Ruby.

                Ruby and her friends ran outside and started playing with her grandparents' dog, Rusty. Rusty was a nice puppy dog that didn’t bite anyone but loved to bite the red striped socks on the washing line.

                The big Jacaranda tree was decorated with sparkly streamers. Under the tree there was a picnic blanket set up with a plate of sandwiches for her and her friends. They all sat together and enjoyed their lunch. Once they finished they heard Grandma call out, “Its time for the circus.” They ran into the tent.

                Inside the tent they saw Grandma dressed as an Acrobat and Grandpa was dressed like a Ringmaster. They started to giggle. A man then walked into the tent with two ponies. Grandpa and the man helped all the children have turns riding on the ponies. After everyone had a turn on the pony, a lady walked in with a big trapeze. The lady helped Grandma swing on the trapeze. Everybody cheered and clapped for Grandma. Then everyone had a turn on the trapeze. They were having a wonderful time.

                When it was time to cut the cake, they all went outside where they saw a big pink circus cake set up on a table under the sparkly tree. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to Ruby. They all had a piece of cake and cupcakes with ice-cream.

                When everyone had left, Ruby ran up to her mum, dad, brother, grandma and grandpa and told them that it was the best birthday she had every had and gave them lots of hugs and kisses.

            story2="""About six months ago, the supervisor of one of my teams left. Since all my other managers were very busy, I stepped in to oversee the team operationally. I was rather rusty and there were many challenges in the team that we needed to conquer and I was a bit overwhelmed. But more about that another one.

                Lisa was a relatively new team member. She was the quiet one in team meetings, slow in adapting to changes and somewhat lacking confidence in her abilities. Due to the changes in the team, I really needed her to step up and expand the scope of her activities. I started to progressively give her new tasks so as not to overwhelm her. However, she kept showing silent or sometimes not so silent resistance to any new activity type, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated.

                After one particularly aggravating incident when she called in sick 30 min after I gave her a new task, I knew we could no longer continue this way. I was planning to have a very tough talk with her and tell her off.

                Fortunately, just then, the Harvard Business Review’s “Why leading with compassion is a better managerial tactic than toughness” article came to me in one of a multitude of serendipitous moments that are sprinkled through my life. It reminded me of something that I already knew well but had for a moment, forgotten in my anger – compassion in leadership promotes employee trust and loyalty.

                With my regained balance, I called her and we started talking. It was still a difficult conversation centered around two areas – what are the reasons for her resistance and what she wants to achieve in our team. Lisa shared that she was a perfectionist and had a strong fear of not completing her tasks as per my expectations and the training she received for her new activities was not sufficient to make her feel confident. She also complained that her current workload does not allow her to take on anything new (which was partially true). She had big ambitions for professional growth, but she did not seem to make the connection that to achieve them, she would need to keep expanding her responsibilities and learning new things. I directed the conversation there and clearly told her that she could not expect growth within my team unless she steps up. It was a stern message to deliver, and I am sure – a difficult one to hear.

                After the conversation, I arranged additional training for her and redistributed some of her work, but honestly, I was not sure she would make it. She had to overcome a deeply instilled fear of failure, and I could not predict whether she would manage.

                Time passed, their new supervisor joined and I stepped back. I could not observe Lisa’s progress very closely anymore, but I noticed that she is taking on more and more responsibilities. I was hesitant to broach the subject with her because I was afraid I would jinx her headway.

                Until a couple of weeks ago, when we had our regular skip-level meeting and she started the conversation with, “Marta, I have been waiting for this conversation. I wanted to tell you that I am not afraid of new things anymore. I realized that the only way you develop is by learning new things. And now when there is a new task, I just go, “bring it on.””

                Let me tell you – I did not stop smiling for three days after that. Fear of failure is one of the most crippling emotions one can experience. And I should know – I have been battling it all my life. But Lisa had managed to shift her focus to her desire for success instead and to keep moving forward. I see a bright future for her in our team.

                Vulnerability is risky on many levels. And it does not help that as managers, we are often taught that vulnerability is a sign of weakness and can damage our professional reputation. Melinda was brought up as a leader in precisely that way. She thought she should focus all work interactions entirely on operational tasks, issues and resolutions. While she gladly accepts others’ vulnerability and is very attuned to their emotions, sharing her own goes against her professional image of herself.

                This approach has brought her excellent results and much success. Still, over time she started realizing that she is not getting everything she needed from her relationships with her manager, her team and her colleagues. She often felt misunderstood and increasingly unhappy.

                Progressively, despite her conditioning to always seem in control and never talk about her own emotions and needs, she started realizing that she would never achieve full job satisfaction unless she opened up. And since this required a great leap of courage, she did it in one big move – in the course of one week, she had meetings with her manager, her team and some of her stakeholders. During those meetings, she, for the first time, managed to express her own feelings and intimate thoughts about her work relationships and her job. She talked about the issues she struggled with and showed up as a human being and not just a manager and professional.

                Since this is not a fairy tale, I cannot lie that everything magically changed after those meetings and now all those relationships are perfect and completely satisfactory for her. But she did open doors for conversations that would never be possible before, and that could eventually lead her to a place of comfort and trust.

                Now, I am often annoyed at people who quote their children and find some profound and deep meaning in everything the kid does or says. But my son is special and very wise (ask anyone who knows him).

                Three years ago, he and his friends encountered an aggressive dog and overnight, he was utterly terrified of anything with a tail. He would cross the street if he would see even a puppy approaching and if a dog got near him, he would scream and jump a mile high.

                This went on for a few months and then Benton appeared. Benton was a small white dog with a brown tail and was my son’s first imaginary friend (he read this and said that Benton was brown with a white rump, but that is not how I remember it). Later he had others too – a cat, a horse, a tiger, an invisible boy. At some point, they went up to eight and it was pretty crowded at home. But Benton was the first one and stayed with us the longest. My son was able to explain what the dog was currently doing at any given moment, and we talked about him often. We even wrote one and a half books about him (I got lazy after that).

                Over time, when we met a dog, after the initial scream, he would look at it and start finding similarities with Benton and show more and more interest in dogs. Two years after Benton came into our lives, my son was able to spend time with dogs and even play with them occasionally. He is still not their biggest fan (we are cat people in our house), but he feels quite comfortable with our friends’ very real dog who lives in our shared yard.

                There is a technique widely used in cognitive therapy called desensitization. It involves controlled exposure to anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus, starting with low intensity and increasing it gradually. I had tried to do that with real dogs, but apparently, no matter how slowly I thought I was moving, it was still too much for him. So he decided to start his desensitization himself with something he can bear – an imaginary dog.

                See, I told you he was wise.

                Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.

                One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.

                "A great many times, Marina," answered her Aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment".

                Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?

                "I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened".
                "It's true!" said Marina, intrigued, "Can you tell me that secret?"
                "Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear".

She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this.

                You have just one more chance to prove you can do it”, the words of my instructor echoed and reechoed in my ears as I got into the plane. Fear was a natural thing, I had heard and I had a common fear which a lot of others had: I was afraid of heights. I had been afraid of even looking down from a high building.

                This fear had been with me from as long as I could remember. It was to overcome my crippling fear of heights that I had decided to join the parachute school. I had gone through a vigorous routine to prepare myself for the big moment. Than at the signal to jump, I had shivered and trembled and started screaming in fear. The instructor had taken me by the hand and led me back into the plane. I was the only one that day who had taken off in the plane and landed-instead of jumping out of it in a parachute. As my companions met me at the base they smirked. I could see that even my good friends were uncomfortable in my presence. I was a failure.

                Then my instructor took me aside. He explained that it was not rare to be afraid. The real valor was in facing and overcoming the fear. I nodded and began to engage in self-talk. In the plane I was still doing this. I kept thinking how I was going to go home and face my parents if I did not get my wings. Then I tried to shutout the fear by imagining myself showing them my wings. The time for the jump grew near.

                The instructor placed his arm on my shoulder to reassure me that I could do it. I nodded and swallowed. My mouth felt dry as I felt the fear arising within me, shiver ran down my spines. I began mumbling affirmations again and then it was my turn. “Jump!” I heard the command and hesitated. “Jump!” shouted the instructor again. I thought no further and took the plunge fairly as I had been drilled.”Bravo” I heard my instructor’s voice in my ears. I fell swiftly and then looked up just in time to see the parachute canopy open above me. Then I looked down.

                As I looked at the beautiful scenario below me, tears glittered into my deep blue eyes, tears of pure joy. I had won. As I floated I remembered all my drills again and began to control my gliding. When I landed, my comrades were upon me laughing and shouting. I could see that they were as contented as I was that I had overcome the greatest enemy of man that is fear.

                Later my instructor landed and gave me a large grin.”I knew you could do it,” he said as he slapped my back, His face beamed with astonishment and mirth. I mumbled my thanks as a smile creased my face and then we ran to the truck with a tremendous feeling of elation.

                “When do we do it again, sir?” I asked the instructor. His reply was drowned in the shouting of my comrades.

                David had avoided flying on airplanes for most of his life because he found himself terrified of crashing. “I couldn’t stop thinking about all the disasters I heard about on the news, and every time I thought about flying, I would begin sweating and my heart started pounding. I only felt better by avoiding travel altogether.”

                But as time went on, David’s fear began to prevent him from doing things he wanted to do. He missed his niece’s graduation and an important work conference, and his fear prevented him from taking his family on the vacation to the coast. “After years of avoidance, I realized this fear was holding me back, and I had to do something about it.”

                David met with a therapist, who encouraged him to examine his thoughts about flying and to question their basis in reality. After some research, David had to admit that his fears about plane crashes were greatly exaggerated in his mind—the flight industry is extraordinarily safe, and accidents are rare. The therapist also taught David some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and visualization, that he could use any time he felt afraid.

                David decided to stop avoiding his fear, and he booked tickets to take his family on their dream vacation. As the flight took off, David focused on keeping his breathing calm and even. Whenever thoughts about crashing entered his mind, he replaced them with a positive thought about how much fun he would have with his family when they arrived. He closed his eyes and imagined the warm sand and waves lapping at his feet, his children laughing and building a sand castle. As the flight progressed, David began to relax. He even enjoyed looking out the window a bit. Anytime he felt himself getting nervous, he gently turned his attention back to his breathing until the feeling passed.

                When the wheels touched the ground, he felt something more powerful than relief: “I felt so proud that I had faced my biggest fear head-on. As we landed, I felt like this thing that had such a powerful hold on me for so long had finally loosened its grip. I knew that I would probably still feel some anxiety when flying, but now I had the tools to face it with mindfulness. I finally feel free.”

            story4="""Once a beggar was upset with his life because he had to beg to run his life. He had to beg for everything. He would remain unhappy about this and thought about how his life would change? Thinking that he would be disappointed.

                Every day he would see that many frustrated people, people with tears in their eyes and troubled by various worries were going towards Gautam Buddha and they were very happy while returning. That beggar could not understand what Gautam Buddha used to do to them so that they would become very happy? While returning there was neither a lot of money in the hands of the people nor gold and silver, then what happened that people were so happy while returning from Buddha?

                Thinking all this, the beggar also decided that he too will go to Mahatma Buddha and see what is happening there that unhappy people go to him and become happy?

                He walked to meet Buddha. Where Buddha was present, there was a very long queue, so that beggar also got in the queue. He started waiting in the queue for his turn. His turn came and he reached near Buddha.

                He said to Buddha, “Buddha I am very poor. I have nothing. I have to beg others even to run my life. Now you tell me that how can I live my life and how can I do it better? “

                On hearing all this the Buddha said, “You are not poor. You think so because till date you have never done anything for anyone. Neither have you ever donated anything to anyone. Nor have you done anything for others.”

                Hearing all this, the beggar was in dilemma. To allay his confusion, the beggar asked, “I am a beggar. How can I donate to people and help people? I have to ask others to run my own life.”

                After hearing all this, Gautam Buddha kept quiet for a while and then said to him, “You have a hand with which you can serve people and do good to others. Also you have mouth so that you say good things and encourage others. You can help others by doing all this. It is not necessary that donations be made only with money. We can also donate education if we want. If the God has given someone a perfectly good body, then he is not poor. He is simply poor in mind. He should move away from this thought and serve others. “

                After listening to all these things of Buddha, that beggar became very happy and his mind was satisfied now.

                Moral of the story – We all waste time worrying that we are poor but this is not true. The truth is that as long as our body is completely better, we can use it to move forward and improve our life. If a person just pays attention to his poverty and does not try to change it then he is a fool.

                Apart from this, we also learn from this story that donations, not only money, education, food, good thoughts, etc. should also be made. If you do not have money, you can education others or you can also share good thoughts to others. This makes society better.

Whereas if we don’t accept it So it goes to the same person who gave the gift. Similarly, it is up to me to accept or not to abort this person. We should never react immediately.

                There was a garden near the palace of King Śuddhodana(Father of Gautam Buddha) where Siddharth used to sit and enjoy nature. One day while he was sitting in his garden, an injured swan fell near his leg. There was an arrow in his body. On seeing the swan, it seemed that some hunter has hunted him.

                Seeing the swan in trouble and seeing it fluttering, Siddhartha’s heart melted and he wanted to help the swan.

                He first took that arrow from the body of that swan and bandaged it with ointment on the injured place. After doing all this, Devdutt came to Siddharth looking for something.

                As soon as Devdutt approached Siddhartha, he said, “Well, it is with you. Bring it to me. I have hunted it. I had to work very hard to hunt it and I have the right to it.”

                On hearing this, Siddharth said to Devadatta, “No, this swan was injured and came to me. I helped it and saved his life. That’s why I have the right over it.”

                There was a debate between the two brothers over the rights of that goose. Now they wanted to know who has more right over that swan? So both of them decided that both of them would go to the king. Siddhartha’s father was the king of Kapilavastu.

                They both went to the king Śuddhodana. As soon as they reached the king, Devdutt first said, “Maharaj, I have the highest authority over this swan because I have hunted it. Because of this you ask Siddharth to give me this swan.”

                As soon as Devdutt’s point was completed, the king pacified both and then asked him what was the whole matter?

                In such a situation, Siddhartha told the king the whole thing and said to him, “Father the thing is that this swan was hunted by Devdutt but this swan got injured and came near my feet. Seeing it injured, I treated it and fixed it. Now tell me that the highest authority on this goose is mine. “

                The king considered this matter well. After considering it, he said one of the biggest things in the meeting and that was, “the right to save more than the one who is killed is the highest. Therefore, the biggest authority over this swan is only and only for Siddhartha because he save that swan. He did not kill it, but treated that swan after seeing it injured and saved its life. After the king had said this, Devdutt understood the matter very well. He also knew that the protector has more rights than the one who killed.

                Moral of the story- From this story we understand that the protector is greater than the one who kill and his authority is greater than the one who is killed. That is why we too should help others and help the troubled people. By doing this we make the society around us better. A good society is the hallmark of a good country. That’s why you also pledge from today that you too will definitely help others.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another with a few of his disciples. While they were travelling, they happened to pass a lake. As Buddha was thirsty, he told one of his disciples to get some water from the lake.

                The disciple gladly obliged and walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that a few people were washing their clothes in the lake and right at that moment, a bullock cart was crossing through the lake. As a result, the water had become muddy and foul. The disciple couldn’t possibly take the dirty water to Buddha. So he returned to Buddha and told him the water was dirty and not fit to drink.

                A half hour later, Buddha again told the disciple to get water from the same lake. The disciple, though perplexed, obediently agreed and walked up to the lake. This time, however, the disciple noticed that the water was crystal clean. The mud had settled down and the water was fit to drink. So he collected some water in a pot and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the pot of water and smiled.

                He said, “See what you did to make the water clean? You did nothing. You just let it be. The mud settled on its own and you got pure water. Your mind is exactly like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it some time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put any effort to calm your mind. It will happen. It’s effortless.”

                Buddha’s message is crystal clear. Achieving inner peace is effortless. It is not something to struggle for. It is an effortless process which will happen on its own. The practice of mindfulness is central to Buddhist philosophy where one observes the thoughts without passing any judgment or reacting to them. There are several mindfulness meditation techniques that can help us in achieving a calm and peaceful state of mind.

                My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter. I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter’s giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through...I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter's giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through her child’s merry eyes.
                We talked about the carefree laughter of childhood before we had bills to pay and so many responsibilities.
                I asked my daughter, "So what makes you laugh when you get older, and the children are grown, and you no longer have to leave cookies out for Santa?"
                "I don’t know, Mom, she said. That’s what I’m expecting you to show me."
                That’s the thing about children; when you think they are grown and you’ve set good examples for them, they remind you that they’re still watching.
                Our children grew up in a pastor's home with many different kinds of people coming and going in their lives in many different places. Teaching our children to have a sense of humor was just as important as teaching them to have a strong prayer life.
                One of my many favorite memories of laughing together as a pastor's family was when a precious older member of our church, who was almost blind with cataracts, would prepare meals and bring them to us. She didn't realize that she mixed all the food on one big serving plate.
                The fried fish was often on top of cottage cheese and pineapple with beans and slaw on top of that. The children wouldn't eat the food and didn't know what to say when she asked them at church how their dinner was.
                A pastor friend suggested we name our garbage can "Spot." So when the sweet lady asked the kids how the food was, they would say, "It hit the spot!" Laughter always made our lives fun and helped us get through stressful times.
                We need laughter in the good times and the bad. Laughter makes us feel good, releases pressure in a bad situation, gives us energy, and makes the most miserable situation bearable at times. In general, it gives us a sense of well-being and a sense of community.
                Doctor Madan Kataria, author of the book, Laughter Yoga, said, "Children can laugh up to 400 times a day, but for adults, this frequency drops to barely 15 times a day."
                It may even be less this year with all the stress our country and families have been through.
                In 1995 Dr. Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai, India, experimented with humor’s therapeutic benefits by approaching strangers in a park in Mumbai. He then invented a series of breathing and relaxation exercises that stimulate merriment for better health called Laughter Yoga.
                Since then, thousands of social laughter clubs have been launched in 65 countries, including the United States.
                Some physicians prescribe laughter classes to the sick, elderly, young, and healthy for its stress-reducing effects. It is proven that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter.
                The physical benefits of laughter include reducing stress hormones, strengthening our immune system, cardiac conditioning, lower blood pressure, {especially in women), and it cleanses the lungs, which can aid in respiratory problems.
                Good reason to add laughter to our lives daily, right?
                When I added up the amount of laughter in my life, I found that most of the people I spend time with are people who like to laugh.
                As inspiration, I look no further than my own friends and family. My neighbor and friend is one particular person who inspires me. She is engaged, curious, strong, beautiful, and fun at age 89 ? exactly the kind of woman I'd love to be when I'm her age, should I have the good fortune to live that long in fine health.
                Listening to her share funny stories of stressful times in her life growing up during the great depression reminds me that there is a funny side to every situation. Spending any time with her reinforces the idea that we need a sense of humor to make it through the tough times in life and gives me new energy and hope for the future.
                My sisters, who were all more than ten years older than me, inspired me the same way. They knew how to use laughter as a healing agent. When we got together, we talk about our life as children. There were sad and painful times for us, but we always managed to turn our shared stories and thoughts into laugher that brought tears to our eyes.
                During the Covid-19 quarantine, I had an amazing friend who sent me videos of funny things and attitudes to cope with the quarantine. She says we need more comedy in our lives, and she is right. The videos were respectfully humorous, and they helped me laugh at myself.
                Laughter doesn’t mean you can’t be serious or that you are insensitive to the bad things happening in the world around us.
                However, it can be the difference between a life of black-and-white and a life filled with color. Laughter may not add years to your life, but it will add life to your years! It’s like a flower that blooms when it stretches towards the sun.
                A wise person realizes eating right and exercise is the best way to stay healthy, and it is a wise person who learns the importance of laughter in their lives.
                If we need a prescription for laughter, it can be found in a book that has been around a long, long time. A Bible verse in Proverbs reminds us that joy is an important part of a healthy life. "A merry heart is good like a medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength." (17:22, NLT)
                Laughing with our grandchildren is the most fun, and we do it a lot. Sometimes when our grandchildren get into trouble, we laugh and remind our children they did the same things when they were that age. But, for some reason, they don't always think that's funny.
                However, being a role model for our adult children has meant demonstrating how to live well and happy in good times and bad. Teaching them always to have a sense of humor and a strong prayer life will be their guide to setting the same example for their children."""

                Many frogs lived in the Champakan pond. Kanduk was a jovial frog. He loved to make other frogs laugh. One day, while Kanduk was entertaining his friends in the pond, King Sher Singh came there to have a bath. Unfortunately, the king stepped on one of Kanduk’s legs and it broke. Kanduk screamed in pain. The king immediately admitted him to the hospital for treatment.

                Doctor Bhola, the bear had to replace Kanduk’s leg with a wooden leg. Kanduk practised using his artificial leg and soon got used to it. Now wherever he went, he would praise his wooden leg a lot. Once Kanduk’s friend Champa, the squirrel was unwell. She was down with typhoid and was admitted to the hospital. When Kanduk heard about it, he went to visit her along with his brother Tandul.
                The hospital was crowded with patients and visitors. Kanduk decided to entertain all the patients and began narrating the story about his wooden leg. He said, “Having a wooden leg has its benefits. It cannot get injured and so does not pain!”  Then he called a patient and gave him a stick. “Hit and see.” That patient, Uluk hit Kanduk’s leg with all his might. Kanduk started laughing. He said, “See, I didn’t get hurt.” Everybody smiled looking at Kanduk. After visiting Champa, Kanduk and Tandul returned home. Kanduk began stroking his leg. Seeing this, Tandul asked, “What happened?”  “Uluk hit me on my real leg by mistake. If I wouldn’t have laughed, how would I have brought smiles on so many faces? It was a small price to pay to make others laugh.” said Kanduk and laughed out loud. Tandul was amazed and said “You are great! Kanduk. You can laugh despite the pain. Laughter is the best Medicine.”

            story3="""Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as “terminally ill”. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500.
                He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, “If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?”
                He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find – Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something funny.
                His pain was so great he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
                He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy, healthy and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
                Some people think laughter is a waste of time. It is a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to indulge in only every so often.
                Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we’re not well, laughter helps us get well; if we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
                Since Cousins’ ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind and the emotions.
                So, if you like laughter, consider it sound medical advice to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don’t like laughter, then take your medicine – laugh anyway.
                Use whatever makes you laugh – movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, New Yorker cartoons, jokes, friends.
                Give yourself permission to laugh – long and loud and out loud – whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you’re strange, but sooner or later they’ll join in even if they don’t know what you’re laughing about.
                Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure. . . laughter.

                “Oh. Hello.” She tried to sound normal. She didn’t feel normal. She felt like she was teetering on the edge of something. That feeling where you’re not sure if it’s laughter or tears — both hysterical — that will come out of your body.
                “I’m lichen it.” His voice was deep, laconic. Australian.
                “What?” Her brow furrowed. The green mask hid her mouth.
                “I’m lichen it.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. The weird feeling was still there. Tears? Laughter? She wasn’t sure, but when it came, she knew she’d have no control. None.
                You see, she’d been locked inside her two-roomed ‘palace’ for 21 days. The whole weird world lockdown had triggered her already fragile self into going into herself, into self-isolation. For longer than 14 days because…well…you never can tell. I mean, perhaps she had touched a metal hand-rail when she took the train, or when she’d walked into the toilets at the cinema. There were germs everywhere. And now they had a name.
                “Barry.” She looked at him, fully into his face, her mouth a little slack with surprise. Her eyes, wide.
                “What?” She wondered if he some kind of telepathy.
                “My name. Barry. And I’m lichen it!” He grinned at her. The lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. And his eyes twinkled. The smile was cheeky. He had no mask. Brave. His brown hair flopped onto his forehead. He had a black t-shirt on, AC/DC on the front.
                She must have looked a little puzzled. Although he could only see her eyes, they must have shown her confusion. He started to laugh. It was a deep laugh. Straight from his belly. It was lovely!
                “The bench! We’re sitting on…” he gesticulated. His hands were broad and capable. Clean too. Fingernails, neat. Blonde hairs on the backs of his hand glistened in the sun.
                It was then she noticed. She who notices everything. Every hair follicle. Every leaf on every tree. Every blade of grass. Every freckle dusting Barry’s arm.
                The bench was covered in lichen!
                She felt it. Not the lichen but the laughter. Bubbling up, like a soda bottle, shaken not stirred. It bubbled up and up and out of her! Such laughter, a beautiful sound! A beautiful feeling! The lichen!
                “I’m lichen it!” he grinned at her again, obviously glad she had reacted.
                She pulled at the mask hiding her mouth, gulping the air as the laughter came, flowing like a stream.
                How could she be laughing? With a stranger? On a park bench? At this time in the world’s history?
                But it wouldn’t be stopped. It flowed! Her every nerve, cell, neuron, given life by laughter, glowed in the sunlight. She put the mask down next to her.
                “So, you’re a lichen expert then,” she chortled, leaning over with the laughter pouring out of her. He began to laugh too.
                “I know what I’m lichen,” he replied, “And I’m lichen you!” His whole face contorted as his laughter burst out of him! He slapped his thigh, leaning backward and forwards as the hilarity took control of him.
                She tried to reply, feeling the peeling lichen under her hands. Laughter had taken control of her. All her fears disappeared in wave after wave of glorious giggles.
                She stood up, held her hand out to him.
                “Come on, Barry! I’m lichen you too! Let’s make like a tree and leave!” She let out a huge gust of laughter. Barry grabbed her hand and stood up, laughing his wonderful belly laugh.
                They wandered off. Who knows where? Nothing was open so perhaps they went back to her place. She left the mask behind.

                Mom dragged the sack into the kitchen of our home in suburban Sherwood Park, Alta. My 10-year-old brother came into the room: “What’s in there? It’s moving.”
                I gave a piercing, seven-year-old-girl shriek. Something in the lumpy bag was struggling to escape. Mom spun around. “Oh, shi—shoot. Take it to the garage.”
                My brother hauled the bag away. In the garage, Mom grabbed the axe from its spot on the wall. Dark-jacketed men, mysterious packages and now axes, I thought. It was turning out to be an interesting day.
                Mom approached the bag like a bomb-squad member, opened the top and retreated a few feet. There was a rustle and then a chicken with a partially detached head blasted out. Dad was a thrifty man, unable to resist the Hutterite’s price for unplucked, freshly killed (or, in this case, mostly killed) poultry.
                The chicken, delighted to be free of the cramped bag and its deceased kin, made several leaps around our garage, like a spasmodic ballerina. Mom’s former-farm-girl know-how abandoned her, and she looked a little sick. She handed my brother (whose closest experience with a live chicken was an undercooked nugget) the axe. “Chop its head off,” she said.
                “Okay.” He took a half step forward, turned pale, then handed the axe back. “You chop it off.”
                The hen ran in enthusiastic circles, letting out garbled squawks, more bothered by captivity than its neck problem. It darted toward us, wings flapping, feathers shedding. We all screamed and tried to hide behind one another. The bird darted away, terrified. Mom admitted defeat, herded us inside and called my father. Until he arrived, she eyed the door as though the chicken might grab the axe itself and hack its way through.
                Hours later, I snuck out to the garage. No more chicken, and the axe was back on the wall. When I asked Dad what happened to the animal, he told me it had run away.
                For months I watched in vain for a droopy-headed chicken lurking in the neighbourhood. To my dad’s credit, no more dark-suited men carrying bags ever arrived at our door again. And, many years later, my brother, still horrified, exclaims, “Mom handed me the axe.”

                A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''


            story_raudra2=  '''Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                No scolding, no timeouts
                It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                Playing soccer with your head
                Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                Why don’t you hit me?
                Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

            story_raudra3= '''Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

Buddha asked him why was he chasing anguli said that I want to kill you , Buddha asked why he told i have to give my guru a guru dakshana. Buddha told that he doesnt want to killed because he have enlight and help lot of people. Anguli refused and said Neither you should live or i must die. Buddha calmly replied, I am not here to kill you. Those words used by Lord Buddha enlightened him at an instance which also made him a devotee and monk of buddha.

            story_raudra5= '''Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                Moral of the story:

                Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

            story_raudra6='''A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''

            story_raudra9=    '''Once there used to be a child who was seen as a

                all the time. He would often get angry and not eat food
                just because he didn't know of a healthier way to release

            story_raudra10= '''One night a snake... while it was looking for food, entered a carpenter’s workshop.
                The carpenter, who was a rather untidy man, had left several of his tools lying on the floor.

                One of them was a saw. As it went around inside the shop, the snake climbed over the saw, which gave it a little cut.

                At once, thinking that the saw was attacking it, the snake turned around and bit it so hard that its mouth started to bleed, enraging the snake even more. The snake continued to attack the saw over and over again until the saw was covered with the snake’s blood. Sadly, the snake did not realize what was actually happening.

                Dying from its own wounds, the snake decided to wrap itself around the saw and began to squeeze with all its strength but alas! it ended up killing itself.

                Sometimes during certain life situations, we react with anger not realizing that we are only hurting ourselves. In life it's better to sometimes ignore situations, people and their behavior. People say and do things but it's our decision whether to react in a positive or in a negative way.

                The carpenter and his tools in this story are like those unpolished, insensitive people and their equally insensitive utterances that cut us in the heart, hurt our sentiments, and cause us emotional damage. But it is up to us to either ignore them and go our way without letting their words touch/harm us or to react foolishly like the snake in this story and end up in a miserable condition due to our short-temper.

                “Soft answers remove anger, Rough words raise rage.”
                I would also say to all foster mom or aunts to understand that they are hurting themselves in a long run'''


            story_raudra11=  '''The school bus would arrive at any moment. Parth hurried to a table to drink his milk. Just then Bhakti, Parth's younger sister arrived there. She took a plate for her breakfast. Her hand mistakenly touched the glass of milk and the milk spilled over Parth's uniform.
                The ripple effects of anger
                "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.
                He was praying all the way that his class teacher should be in a good mood and pardon his coming late. But no prayers of pardons seemed to work for D.K sir. Parth's punishment was to go out on the ground and run one mile. He felt very embarrassed. All the way while running, Parth was burning inside. He blamed Bhakti for his punishment and was waiting to return home and scold her.
                He was very tired and exhausted because of his anger. When he returned home, he saw that Bhakti was studying for her geography test. "Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu", Bhakti was memorizing the capitals of Indian states. Parth entered the room and heard Bhakti's voice.
                "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                The ripple effects of anger2
                His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.

                        After a few minutes, the Father asked his Son the 2nd time, “What is this?”
                        The Son said “Father, I have just now told you “It’s a crow”.
                        After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son the 3rd time,
                        What is this?”
                        At this time some expression of irritation was felt in the Son’s tone when he said to his Father with a rebuff. “It’s a crow, a crow, a crow”.
                        A little after, the Father again asked his Son the 4th time, “What is this?
                        This time the Son shouted at his Father, “Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times ‘IT IS A CROW’.
                        Are you not able to understand this?”
                        A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:-
                        “Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. 
                        I did not at all feel irritated I rather felt affection for my innocent child”. 
                        While the little child asked him 23 times “What is this”, the Father had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the Son felt irritated and annoyed.
                        From today say this aloud, “I want to see my parents happy forever. They have cared for me ever since I was a little child.
                        They have always showered their selfless love on me.
                        They crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today”.

                        A student asks a teacher, “Why often people marry a different person then they fell in love with?”  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the wheat field and choose the best wheat and come back.  But the rule is that you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the field, went through the first row, he saw one big wheat which he instantly liked, but he wonders that maybe there is a bigger one further.  Then he saw another bigger one, but again he thought that maybe there is an even bigger one waiting for him.
                        Later, when he finished more than half of the wheat field, he started to realize that the wheat is not as big as the ones he let go off, he started to realize that he had missed the best one in the search of a bigger.  So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.  This is the mistake often made by people who fell in love and lost the best person they could have in their life”.
                        So, the student said, “Does that mean, one should never fall in love?”  The Teacher replied, “No Dear,  Anyone can fall in love if they find a suitable person.  But, once you truly fall in love, you must never let go of that person due to your anger, ego or comparisons with others”.
                        “How do they end up marrying someone other than they loved?” the student asked.  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the corn field and choose the biggest corn and come back. But the rule is same as before, you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the corn field, this time he was careful to not to repeat the previous mistake.  When he reached to the middle of the field, he picked one medium corn that he felt satisfied with and went back to the teacher.  He described how he made a choice.  The teacher told him, “This time you didn’t came empty handed.  You looked for one that is just nice, and you had put your faith that this is the best one you can get.  This is how one makes a choice for marriage.”
                        The student stood confused.  The teacher asked, “What is bothering you now?”  The student replied, “I am wondering which would have been better, marrying a person you love or loving the person you marry”.  The teacher replied, “It’s a very easy answer, only if you are willing to admit it to yourself”.

                        Two inseparable friends, Sam and Jason, met with an accident on their way to Boston City. The following morning, Jason woke up blind and Sam was still unconscious. Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me. "Dr Berkeley was moved at Sam's deed. All that he could say was, "You are a very brave man Sam and God will make it up to you in one way or another". While he was moving on to the next patient, Sam called back at him almost pleading, "promise me you won't tell Jason anything".
                        "You know I won't do that. Trust me." and walked away.
                        "Thank you " whispered Sam. He smiled and looked up in prayer " I hope I live up to your ideas...please give me the strength to be able to go through this..Amen"
                        Months later when Jason had recuperated considerably, he stopped hanging around with Sam. He felt discouraged and embarrassed to spend time with a disabled person like Sam.
                        Sam was lonely and disheartened ,since he didn't have any body else other than Jason to count on. Things went from bad to worse. And one day Sam died in despair. When Jason was called on his burial, he found a letter waiting for him. Dr Berkeley gave it to him with an expressionless face and said" This is for you Jason. Sam had asked me to give it to you when he was gone". 
                        In the letter he had said: " Dear Jason, I have kept my promise in the end to lend you my eyes if anything had happened to them. Now there is nothing more that I can ask from God, than the fact,that will see the world through my eyes. You will always be my best friend........Sam".
                        When he had finished reading Dr. Berkeley said " I had promised Sam to keep his sacrifice he made a secret from you. But now I wish I didn't stick it Because I don't think It was worthy it".
                        All that was left for Jason while he stood there was tears of regret and memories of Sam for the rest of his life.

                        Lesson of the story:
                        No matter what If we make a friend, we should stick by him till the end. Life is meaningless without a friend.

                        Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
                        Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for you, Daddy.”
                        The man became embarrassed by his overreaction earlier, but his rage continue when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her; “Don’t you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside?”
                        The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried;
                        “Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They’re all for you, Daddy.”
                        The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness.

                        It was a crisp morning on June 15th,2005 when I got a call from my father, “Its a girl” he said. My joy knew no bounds and I danced around my balcony announcing the news of the new arrival to my neighbors.         
                        My elder sister, Smitha(26yrs), delivered a girl on June 15th,2005. It was such a blessing for all of us. She stayed with us through her pregnancy and it was a wonderful bonding time for us. I would take care of her sleep, food, etc and be extra cautious to her. I even decorated my room with posters showcasing ‘cute’ babies.
                        I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                        I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                        It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                        I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                        I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                        That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                        As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                        She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                        I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                        As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                        People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                        Why, out of all the girls he had, did he have to choose to hurt me?” The girl cried, showed the bruises which she did because of him.She came back to reality as familiar fingers caressed her hair, the other hand tracing patterns on her arm.
                        “Do you want me to be honest?” I asked, wiping her tears, holding her hands. she nodded and moved her head but she wants to listen.
                        “Well..” She began, putting her arms around me in a warm embrace. 
                        “You are innocent. You are beautiful; unused. I think he liked that. All of the other girls he’d met had been screwed over already. But you were pure. Too pure for his dirty hands.”
                        Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                        “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                        She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                        “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                        That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                        Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                        Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                        Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                        I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                        My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                        Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                        “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                        How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                        I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                        And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                        She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                        She will teach me to do the right things,

                        She will guide me through the right path,

                        She will motivate me during my bad times,

                        She will pray for me and for my future,

                        She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                        And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                        Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                        I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                        She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

                I just never knew you would turn out to be so much harmful; else, never I must have bothered to you. A friend would never do something like what you did. I indeed feel unenviable to recollect the fact that we were friends.

                I remember when I first met you. It was quite a sunny day, and our first day at college. Students of the new batch were to assemble in the main hall. It was the first time when I caught a glimpse of you. You were in your red shorts and a plain black t-shirt, with a ponytail and you looked very fine. Some boys even wanted to talk to you. I purposely stood next to you. I genuinely thought you might be a generous girl with a firm attitude. Our college principal began his speech to his New Year students and we stood straight.


                
                Suddenly a choking voice of the microphone came out of the speakers in a very harsh voice, some of the students started laughing about it, and you were one of them. You shouted and howled like a guy, and it was outrageous to see a girl doing such stuff. You suddenly turned to me and laughed, expecting that I too must laugh on this, but I just smiled at you gladly. I was very happy to get your attention, but your behavior wasn’t comforting. I desperately needed a friend in the new college, new town and most importantly a new life after school.

                We were to move back to the mess for the food. I again purposely sat next to you, hoping to have a conversation. You took my presence and began talking to me. Really, you were too amiable to me. You did not let me feel that was our first conversation, especially the way you hit me on my back repeatedly, just as if how usually boys do! I learnt you love sports, and basketball was your game. Well, it was too obvious to know, you were a tomb boy. But whatever you were, I was happy to have a good-looking sport-loving girl as my friend. We exchanged our numbers and came in contact. You lived in the college residence but I lived with my relatives in the town.


                
                Then we kept on meeting very often. Gradually, we went on being good friends. Nevertheless, you made me feel deplorable sometimes the way you dealt with others. You often cracked jokes on others, badgered and annoyed our classmates with your irritating tricks and abused girly girls for the way they dressed themselves. Sometimes, you did not spare even me with your endurable spirit of teasing. People asked me huge times to remain away from you. They all had come to know we didn’t share any single quality and that I was just being nice to you. Unfortunately, their perception was true. Many a times I felt like I should quit your friendship, but one thought always stopped me to proceed, as you were the only friend of mine, who was so popular, handsome and undeniably, my first friend in the college. But it was becoming too harder to remain friends with you.

                After a lot of patience, I decided to get separated from your friendship. I started ignoring you a bit, like if you appeared in my sight, I pretended as if I have not seen you. But I guess you caught me. You soon understood my ignorance. You came to me and directly asked me if there was anything wrong. This one single thing was only appreciating, that you were always straight in your talks. You never tangled the confusions or talked indirectly, which I definitely lacked. I then settled things by providing lame explanations. Somehow you accepted and never bothered about my ignorance as you were too much busy with your sports.


                
                Our first year came near to end. You won us the inter college basketball championship, as the captain. Principal and every one appreciated for your efforts. Really, we all were proud of you. Unluckily our exams were just one month after. You did not study the entire year and were always engaged in your basketball shots and strategies. You were horrified to see such lny syllabus and were all confused. You asked me to help you in studies. I agreed. However, I just did not know you thought me a fool. You wanted me to complete all your assignments and projects. I somehow did. You wanted me to teach you like a tutor, fill your mind with everything given in our textbooks. I agreed to explain you though, but you were not satisfied with whatever I taught you. You treated me very gratingly as if I owed a lot to you. I did every possible thing for you to get ready for exams, but still you were not gratified. You wanted more out of me; you wanted me to give more and more time to you. But I had to study for my exams too.I tried to tell you indirectly that I can’t do anything more than this, but I guess you did not want to understand my problems.


                
                I was extremely chafed by your behavior. I then decided to completely dismiss, no matter what. I began ignoring your calls and messages. I switched off my cell phone. You were annoyed by this attitude of mine and got impatient. You visited me at my place un-announced, and burst in anger. You capper clawed, yelled and abused me as if I did a crime by not giving attention to you. As soon as you left, I uttered a great cry and kept on weeping that whole night.

                We were not friends anymore. I decided never to talk to you, so did you. After that day, we often saw each other; but we turned our heads in other directions each time. Nevertheless, I’m just not hesitant to tell you, that now I actually love life without you. Moreover, I need you to know, that Friend, you are not tolerable!

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...

                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                Once upon a time there was a zombie called Patizombi, who was fed up with being the villain in everyone’s stories. So, to prove that he could do good, he decided to go hunting evil ghosts.

                But ghosts aren’t very visible and they’re sneaky too. It was only after many failed attempts that Patizombi spotted a confused ghost floating through the forest. He approached it carefully, set out his traps and jumped on him.

                The battle was going very badly until Patizombi realized that he was in fact not fighting a ghost but a clingy bedsheet he’d been trapped by.

                “Ha, ha, ha! You have fallen right into my trap, you evil zombie!” A ghost laughed, emerging from his hiding spot.

                “Ahh, evil ghost,” Patizombi replied. “I’ll catch you one day.”

                “No, no, no, no and no!” said the ghost, incredibly offended. “Excuse me, but I am a good ghost and my job is to hunt evil zombies.

                “Oh no you don’t!” objected Patizombi, “because I am a good zombie, and I am the one who hunts evil ghosts.”

                After arguing for a little while, they realised they were both telling the truth. They found it funny and became friends.

                “I suppose not all ghosts are evil…”

                “Nor all zombies…”

                “We could join forces to hunt ogres”

                And they headed as a team into the mountains, where the most fearsome ogres were hidden. Working quickly together, they found the track of an ogre that led them to a cave. As the ogre was out, they prepared a trap but while they were doing so a giant stone fell and blocked the entrance leaving them trapped.

                “Ha, ha, ha! it was so easy to trap that evil zombie and his ghostie partner!”

                “Lies!” they protested from inside, “We are not evil. The only evil one is you and we have come to catch you!”

                Once again, the discussion carried on until everyone was persuaded that none of them was evil.

                “We would never have thought that good ogres existed”

                “Neither would I have thought that a zombie and a ghost were not evil”

                It is obvious that, before you set out to hunt anyone, you need to make sure that they are evil...

                That is how they discovered that, even if a creature has a reputation for being evil, it is not always true. And this is also true for all other creatures who have a reputation for being dirty, noisy or annoying: you can never tell which ones are actually like that without first getting to know them. That is how they found many more zombies, ghosts and good ogres who joined their group of catchers of evil creatures. Everyone trusted this valley police force, which never allowed anyone to be treated badly due to prejudice and to bad reputations they did not deserve.

                There was once a fairy who was learning how to be a fairy godmother. Most magic and wonderful, she was the kindest and cleverest of all fairies. However, she was also a very ugly fairy. And no matter how much she showed her wonderful qualities, it seemed that everyone was determined to believe that the most important thing about a fairy was her beauty. In the fairy school they ignored her, and every time she flew off on a mission to help a child or anyone else in trouble, before she could say a word they were already screeching and yelling at her: "Ugly! Get out of here, weirdo!"

                Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful. But then she remembered what her mother had always told her: "My dear, you are what you are, warts and all; and never doubt that you are this way for a very special reason..."

                But then, one day, the witches of the neighbouring land invaded and destroyed the country, putting all the fairies and wizards in prison. Our fairy, just before being attacked, put a spell on her own clothes and, helped by her ugly face, she managed to pass for a witch. That way she was able to follow the witches back to their den.

                Once there she used her magic to prepare a big party for everyone, decorating the cave with bats, toads and spiders. The music was provided by a pack of howling wolves. While the party was in full swing, the fairy hurried off and set free all the fairies and wizards who had been imprisoned. When all of them were free, they worked together on one big spell which succeeded in trapping the witches inside the mountain for the next hundred years. And for the next hundred years, and more, everyone remembered the great bravery and intelligence of the ugly fairy.

                And from that day on no one in that land ever saw ugliness as a disgrace. Whenever someone ugly was born, people were filled with joy, knowing that for that new person great things lay ahead.

                Mr. Horsefly was the new head of the prairie post office. He had put a lot of time and effort into getting this highly respected position; he had even moved fields. If you asked Mr. Horsefly, he would tell you that he got the job thanks to his great deductive gifts.

                On his first day at work, he opened up shop, and into the post office came Mr. Beetle, Mrs Spider, Miss Mantis, and Mr. Grasshopper.
                Mr. Horsefly wouldn't let them so much as open their mouths.

                "Don't tell me, don't tell me. I bet I can work out what each of you came for," he said, putting a book, a plastic mat, a nail file, and some protective goggles on the counter.

                "The nail file will be for Mrs. Spider, without a doubt. With all the scratching she does, she'll need to put her nails right. “The mat”, he went on, without giving anyone time to react, "without even having to think about it, I give it to Mr. Grasshopper, since he must have to train pretty hard to keep all his hopping about up to a decent standard. The safety goggles have to be for Mr. Beetle, because having to spend all day with his face so close to the ground, he'll be needing something to protect his eyes. And finally, this big book here, has to be a Bible. I'll have to give that to Miss Praying Mantis, whom I would like to ask to include me in her supplications to The Almighty. As you will see..."

                They didn't let him finish. The comment about the mantis - well known on the prairie for having changed her name from Miss Praying Mantis to simply Miss Mantis - was just too much for everyone, and they burst out laughing...

                "Not much of a detective, are you!" said Mr. Grasshopper, between chuckles. "For a start, Mrs. Spider came for the book. She's very quiet, and doesn't scratch a soul. The mat is for Mr. Beetle, who likes to sunbathe in his swimming pool, and do it lying on his back. Miss Mantis will, of course, want the nail file. She's a bit of a flirt, you know. And the protective goggles are for me. I'm not as young as I was, and don't see to well. These days when I'm hopping on the grass I get the odd black eye..."

                “Uhu”, Mr. Horsefly interrupted, recovering a little from his embarrassment, "then you do, in fact, hop on grass!"

                "Yes, I do," answered the grasshopper, "but as you'll see, making your deductions based simply on prejudice, leads to more misses than hits..."

                How right he was! Just a few days later, after having met all the insects in person, Mr. Horsefly had a good laugh while telling this story about his deductions made from prejudice without yet having met a soul. And he understood that judging without knowing is a practice for fools.

                XT-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read "XT-27: The best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other XT-27s.

                "All robots should be like us XT-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the XT-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

                One day, he was walking along in Bionic City, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors (that's eyes to you and me, but XT-27 liked to use highly technical sounding words for everything).

                He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an XT-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were XT-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing!

                Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XT-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble (a house), on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were XT-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more.
                On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time.

                So XT-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another XT-27.
                So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push...
                When he woke up, the XT-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The XT-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The XT-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "XT-28, the best, most modern robot".
                So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The XT-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn't feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points.

                The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and... started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there.

                The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair.

It was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends.

                And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.

Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby.

                Reggie didn't like this very much. But the person who disliked it the most was his friend Michael, who decided one day that things had to change. Michael's father was the town´s Mayor, and Michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of Reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs.

                People liked the idea, because everyone loved Reggie. The day became known as The Day of Silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: Reggie was amazing!

                On that day no one was thinking of Reggie as just a deaf person. This meant he could be treated just like any other little boy; and people saw a whole new side of him. Not only that, but Reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, Reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all Reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference.

                So the Day of Silence was the day Reggie´s true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head.

                One day, in the land of the orange elephants, a little bird swore that he had seen some purple cows. No one believed him, so the bird asked them to follow him to the border. When they arrived, they could see that it was true. Off in the distance was a completely purple land. The purple cows were equally amazed to see orange elephants. The two groups of animals got together and decided to go in search of the land of the dark blue crocodiles.

                And so began a journey through many lands of many colours, each adding its own special animal to the expedition. When all the animals were together, heavy rain began pouring, and the rain mixed the animals´ colours up, leaving each one with the colour they have today.

                Pete Sparks was a sensitive boy. So sensitive that even his hair was ticklish. You only had to touch his hair a little bit and he would burst out laughing. And when this ticklish laughter started, no one could make him stop.

                So Pete grew up used to strange situations. When his granny’s friends came to visit, he would always end up in stitches because there was never any shortage of little old ladies rubbing his head and saying “How cute!”

                Windy days were the worst, with Pete on the ground, paralyzed by laughter whenever the breeze blew on his locks, which, incidentally, were pretty long because at the barber shop no one could manage to cut his hair, due to the non-stop giggling. To see Pete laugh, as well as being great fun, was terribly contagious. When Pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing.

                As Pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places. Some activities are serious business, and cannot be done amid gales of laughter. So Pete tried everything to control his ticklishness: he tried wearing a thousand different hats, he used ultra strong hairsprays and gels, he shaved his head, and he even went on a yoga course to see if he could bear the tickling by learning to relax himself.

                But nothing worked; it was impossible. He wanted, with all his heart, to just be a normal boy. So, as time went on, he began to feel sad and ill-fated for being different.
                This went on until, one day in the street, he met a special clown. The clown was very old and could hardly walk, but when he saw Pete in tears, he went to cheer him up. It didn’t take long to make Pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown.

                “I have no one to replace me”, said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do”. Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought “serious? A clown?”, trying to understand what the old man had told him.

                “Come, I’ll show you” said the clown.

                So the clown took Pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show Pete’s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter.

                When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at Pete and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age”.

                “It’s true,” answered Pete, smiling and returning the wink, “not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. And that’s so hard to find”. This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter.

                And that is how Pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that Pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days. While they were traveling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.

                The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha, The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.

                After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.

                Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.

                What did Buddha emphasize here? He said, It is effortless. Having 'peace of mind' is not a strenuous job; it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment, such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.

One of the pictures among the various master pieces was of a calm lake perfectly mirroring peacefully towering snow-capped mountains. Overheard was a blue clear sky with fluffy clouds. The picture was perfect. Most of the people who viewed the pictures of peace from various artist thought that it was the best among all.

The sky looked very angry, there were lightning.  This did not look peaceful at all. It looked like the artist has mistakenly submitted his painting depicting storm rather than peace.  But if anyone looked closely at the painting, he could see a tiny bush growing in the cracks in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her next. In the midst of the rush of angry weather, the bird sat on her nest with peace.

The real peace is the state of mind, not the state of the surroundings. The mother bird at her her calm, despite her chaotic surrounding indeed was the best representation for peace.

                – It is simple, – he said. — I will destroy all weapons on the Earth, and nobody will be able to fight anymore.

                – It would be great! –people exclaimed.

                The magic wand’s wave – and this was done.

                There was a peace on the planet for three days, while the majority of those who were prone to fight, sought and could not find a weapon. When they understood they’ve lost it forever, they have made spears of young trees and started to fight again.

                When the wizard heard this bad news, he said:

                – Do not worry. I will destroy all young trees, so that they will not be able to fight.

                After two or three days of useless search for young trees, suitable for making spears, rebellious people started to cut giant trees, make batons from them, and the bloodshed has started again. The Wizard destroyed all big trees. Then humans made knives and swords of metal. He destroyed all metal on the planet. People made sling and began to throw stones at each other. It was necessary to destroy the stones, too. And then peacekeepers began to worry: all trees have disappeared; there is no metal and stones. How to live, what to eat now? There will be no vegetation soon, and people will die without even fighting. No, this is a wrong solution of the problem.

                The Wizard became confused:

                – I do not know how to behave now. I would have destroyed all humanity, but, unfortunately, it is not in my power!

                The peacekeepers fell into despair; they did not know what to do. And then one clever kid turned to the Wizard.

                – I know what you should do. Let people feel, how others perceive their actions. If one person hurt someone, let him feel the same pain, and if he brings joy to someone, let him feel the same joy. So no one will hurt each other, because he will feel the pain immediately too and would have to stop.

                All people were inspired with the greatness of kid’s thought, and the wizard realized his idea. He returned all trees, stones and metals.

                Since that day nobody on the planet tried to hurt his neighbour, because he would have to feel the same pain too. People began to help each other, because they liked the sense of joy they felt at this moment. And they began to live in harmony and joy.

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...
                
                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”
                “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.
                The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,“Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If U have any question, ask the nurse!!”
                “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
                The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”

                There was a monk who lived on the edge of a small town, much to the delight of the townspeople. Whenever he ventured into town to help someone, everyone came out of their homes to give him gifts from their gardens, calling out to him, "Oh, Teacher, we're so fortunate to have you living nearby! You are such a wonderful person! You do so much good, Teacher! Your presence is such a blessing!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                One day a young woman came to the monk's hut and said, "Oh, Teacher, I'm in terrible trouble. I'm pregnant and my family will disown me. The young man who I love so much has fled to another town because my family would certainly do him harm. I have nowhere else to turn and no one else to ask for help."

                The monk replied that she could live in the back room and help around the house and she would then have the security of a home for her child.

                Well, now when the monk went into town, he was reviled. "You dirty old man! Look how you have betrayed our trust and taken advantage of that young woman! How could we have ever believed in you? What shame you have brought on us!" And they hurled rotten fruit at him along with their insults.

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                After a while, the father of the child returned to the town and presented himself before the family, saying, "I have spent the past two years learning a trade in a neighboring town and now I am able to provide a home for your daughter and grandchild." The family was overjoyed. Although it wasn't the best of situations, it was so much better than they had feared that they welcomed their daughter and grandchild back into the family with open arms.

                How different it was when the monk came into town then. The townspeople lined the road every time, presenting him with gifts of food and calling out, "Oh, Teacher, how could we have ever doubted you? Look at the wonderful thing you have done! We are so ashamed! Please forgive us! You are such a wise and compassionate person! We are so fortunate to have you living nearby!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                While there is no single interpretation that would do justice to this story, it certainly speaks to the equanimity of the monk. Against the backdrop of praise and condemnation, he holds himself apart from "what everyone thinks" even as he acts with the most compassionate and involved sense of responsibility. Whether in public or the workplace or in the privacy of home life, people will misread our intentions and jump to conclusions that cast us in a bad light. The most straight-forward lesson of this story, then, is that by continuing on the most ethical course of action our true intents become known. This, however, can be a short-lived vindication as the same thing may happen all over again: We ought not be pulled off-center by shallow praise any more than by shallow criticism.

The troubles weighed on her grief and eventually broke her spirit and she died without ever telling her son about the jewel.

It doesn't matter what the subject is, we are fully capable of taking sides and then feeling the need to prove ourselves "right." The lesson of "seeing ourselves seeing" is a necessary one if we are to develop the witness awareness that watches habit thoughts and feelings arise automatically. Interrupting ingrained reactions to things allows us to consciously create new reactions that better reflect our current stage of development.

                n Ayodhya, there was a beautiful white pigeon. A very special kind. That beautiful white pigeon could fly high in the blue sky up from one tree to another tree, from one rooftop to another. Her wings made sounds like Phad... Phad… Phad... and she never seemed to mind because she had faith in her own capacities gifted by God… on her powerful wings!

                The pigeon lived in her nest made on Noore Allah Masjid, made with straws & threads collected from St. Mary’s Church near the Gurudwara.

                The pigeon flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir, and then she flew right back again. Birds have no religions, then why we humans?

                One sad day, when the pigeon flew out, it started to rain. Although she flew with all her might, she couldn’t get home again. She beat her wings against the rain, but they got wet and slowly some feathers drooped from her wings, and shewas injured due to this.

                The pigeon tried her best to fly. But she knew that she was “pooped.”

                A kind 7-year-old girl, Krishna, was watching that troubled pigeon. Krishna was enjoying a bath in the rain that time.

                Krishna saw the poor pigeon fall into her garden. Krishna felt that in that situation her duty was quite simple. She took that tiny frail bird and kept her warm and dry. She gave her water so she could drink, some food to eat and told her, “Not to cry... you will be o.k. soon Mashkalli!”

                Krishna named the pigeon “Mashkalli” because of Mashkalli’s beautiful white colour and eyes like diamonds. Krishna told Mashkalli, “You look like a “Shantidoot… Messenger of Peace & love!”

                Krishna cared for Mashkalli for fifteen days, until Mashkalli became quite strong. Krishna took Mashkalli everywhere she went, to school, to work, and to play. They grew very close during this period.

                One day Krishna watched Mashkalli fearfully. Krishna knew Mashkalli wouldn’t be there long.

                “Please, mummy, may I keep this bird Mashkalli? Now Mashkalli loves me and I love her. We are friends; I just can’t let him go.” Krishna’s voice was sad and low when she requested her mother.

                Krishna’s mother spoke softly and gently. She knew just what to say, “Look Krishna! Mashkalli’s home is somewhere else. Mashkalli’ must soon fly away... our garden has been a resting place for her, just like a small hotel or hospital. Krishna, it is nice of you that you took care of your bird friend Mashkalli. In her troubled time. However, this does not mean that you can keep her in any cage. If you really love someone, let us free them! If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly come back to you someday…!”

                Yes, what Krishna’s mother said was very true. It happened the next day. Mashkalli circled overhead, and then she flew away, as Krishna watched.

                Krishna felt a little sad for a few days because she was missing Mashkalli a lot. However, Krishna had full faith in her mother’s words. “If you really love someone you have to free them. If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly comeback to you someday…!”

                Now Mashkalli was rather home again. She was feeling very happy. Mashkalli again started to flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir.

                Now, “The Messenger of Peace & love: Shantidoot Mashkalli” takes a little longer flight. Mashkalli always stops at Krishna’s garden to tell her friend hello, pay thanks, and play with her every morning.

                If this, an uneducated bird can pay thanks to her helper, why not we, so called educated humans…?”

                In the rising sun’s light of hope, little Krishna was thinking this, and Shantidoot Mashkalli was eating food from Krishna’s little, soft palm, sitting on her hand. Krishna’s mother was watching that special friendship of an innocent human and an innocent bird. She smiled.

                REALLY LOVE SOMEONE? FREE THEM…

                A man woke up in the middle of a dirt road. Half of his face had brown dirt covering it, and his hair was a mess. His shirt was ragged, and he had lost a shoe. His vision was all blurry, and he was squinting in the sunlight, struggling to make use of his eyes. He could see a few hazy trees in the distance, beyond the expanse of dry, yellow land and grass. He had been in an accident. He had fallen from his buggy, banged his head, and had forgotten everything about himself. He had woken up with absolutely no memory of anything whatsoever. He knew he should have some memories, but he could locate none. He became very afraid. Who was he? How had he got here?

                As his vision continued to adjust to his surroundings, he saw a pile of papers on the ground, and a little red booklet resting on the top of them, just a few meters from where he was. He had not noticed, however, that a few meters to the left of this pile of information, was a lion.

                The lion walked gently in front of the papers, creating a barrier between them and the man. Then the lion sat down on his hindquarters, and looked at the man in the eyes.

                The man did not move. He was well aware that it was a lion now.

                "I saw what happened," said the lion, seeing that the man had no idea.

                "You were driving too fast in that thing," the lion nodded towards the buggy further down the dirt road, which was tipped over on its side. "And you fell out. These papers have all your information on them, your name, address – all of your details."

                The man felt like he was frozen to the warm earth beneath him.

                "Oh, and don't worry," added the lion, forgetting how things may have appeared to the man "...I'm not particularly hungry."

                "May I have the papers?" asked the man, wishing to get away with his details as quickly as possible.

                "Yes, of course," said the lion, standing up and ready to remove the blockade he had created.

                "Oh, thank you," said the man, relieved, "I don’t even remember who I am!"

                At this the lion stopped. He sat back down. This was too good to spoil. A man who had no ideas about himself? No psychological baggage at all? No identity to speak of? Oh, how wonderful...

                "Ah, amnesia of the self," said the lion, feeling refreshed. "Beautiful."

                "What do you mean beautiful?" asked the man impatiently, "I need my identity back! I mean...who am I? I know nothing of my past, not even my own name! Please!" he begged, "The papers!"

                "Listen to yourself panicking like this," the lion chuckled. "This is quite silly."

                "But I have absolutely no identity!" cried out the man, pleading for this lion to give him some information about himself.

                "I will give you these papers," said the lion, "but I want you to look at something. At the moment you know nothing about yourself, but you do not deny your own existence. You are begging me to give you your name and personal history, because without these stories you feel you are nothing, no one – that you don’t exist without your identity. But you are still here. Do not confuse your name, history and occupation with who you are. You exist, no matter what your story, what your name. If you were not so desperate for labels and definitions to create an identity for yourself, you would feel so free, so happy, so at one with this creation. Can you not just be comfortable having no definitions for a moment, and really be aware of what you truly are?

                "This is a blessing in disguise,” added the lion.

                This man felt he could not argue with the lion anymore, so he followed his orders. Who was he? This was what he was trying to find out through the information on those papers. But the lion was right, at the moment this man had no ideas about himself, yet somehow, his existence was being fully felt. His existence was present, but now it was no longer connected to any ideas. His existence was not limited to any particular form, it was everywhere, making up everything.

                The lion was now standing, looking at the man, with dark, deep eyes. As the man looked back at the lion, he felt like whatever was looking out of the lion's eyes, was not separate from what was looking out of his own.

                "Now you can have the papers." The lion pushed them with its paw towards the man, and they made a scraping noise on the ground. The man crouched down, picked them up, but now was not so eager to give himself a description. He figured these papers would be useful so he could find his house, get his bearings, but he didn’t need them to know who he was just yet. He placed them in his back pocket, and skipped off towards the hut he could now see in the distance, completely free of the ideas about himself he previously had.

                There abode in Thessaly, in the days of Hercules, a strange race of men who had the head and arms of a man together with the body of a horse. They were called Centaurs, or Bull-Slayers.

                One of them named Cheiron, famous for his knowledge of medicine, music and botany, had been the teacher of Hercules. But many of them, although learned, were not good. Hercules and Theseus had waged war on them and had killed many, so that their numbers were greatly lessened.

                Having married Deianira, the daughter of a powerful King of Calydon, in Greece, Hercules was traveling home with her when he came to the banks of a river and was at a loss how to cross it. Seeing his perplexity, Nessus, one of the Centaurs, offered to take Deianira on his back and carry her over the stream. This offer Hercules gladly accepted.

                No sooner, however, did the crafty Centaur obtain possession of Deianira than he made off with her, intending to have her as his own wife. You can easily imagine how angry this outrage made Hercules. He shot one of his poisoned arrows with so much force that it went right through the traitor Centaur, and wounded him even unto death.

                But, before dying, Nessus had time to tell Deianira that if she wanted to keep Hercules always true to her she had but to take his shirt, and, when her husband's love was waning, prevail on him to wear it.

                Deianira took the shirt, and shortly afterwards, being afraid that her husband was ceasing to love her, she sent it to him as a present.

                Now, you will remember that Hercules had shot through the shirt of Nessus one of his poisoned arrows, and you will not be surprised to hear that some of the poison had remained in the shirt. So when Hercules put it on, which he did immediately upon receiving it, he was seized with frenzy and, in his madness, he uttered terrible cries and did dreadful deeds.

                With his powerful hands he broke off huge pieces of rock, tore up pine-trees by their roots and hurled them with resounding din into the valley.

                He could not take off the fatal shirt, and as he tore off portions of it he tore, at the same time, his quivering flesh.

                The servant of Deianira who had carried him the fatal shirt, and who wished to solace him in his pain, he seized as she approached him and flung headlong into the sea, where she was changed into a rock that long, so runs the legend, kept its human form.

                But at ln the majesty and the courage of the hero asserted themselves, and, although still in agony, his madness left him.

                Calling to his side his friend Philoctetes, he wished to embrace him once more before dying; but fearful lest he should, in so doing, infect his friend with the deadly poison that was consuming him, he cried in his agony: "Alas, I am not even permitted to embrace thee!"

                Then he gathered together the trees he had uprooted and made a huge funeral pyre, such as was used by the ancients in burning their dead. Climbing to the top of the heap, he spread out the skin of the Nemean lion, and, supporting himself upon his club, gave the signal for Philoctetes to kindle the fire that was to reduce him to ashes.

                In return for this service he gave Philoctetes a quiver full of those deadly arrows that had been dipped in the blood of the Hydra of Lerna.

                He further enjoined his friend to let no man know of his departure from life, to the intent that the fear of his approach might prevent fresh monsters and new robbers from ravaging the earth.

                Thus died Hercules, and after his death he was received as a god amongst the Immortals on Mount Olympus, where he married Hebe, Jove's cupbearer. In his honor mortals were commanded to build altars and to raise temples.

                The county recreation center swimming pool where one gets such badges presents very different conditions to those created when a June storm dumped six inches of rain over Columbia in Missouri with little warning—causing floodwaters from creeks to burst their banks, causing overflow zones to turn into ponds.

                When 15-year-old Dominic Viet and 16-year-old Joseph Diener passed a basketball court that had turned essentially into a water polo area, they heard the frantic shouting of a young woman desperately trying to keep her head above water under the force of a current.

                The boys had seen the girl swimming with a friend there before, but it was now obvious she was drowning.

                “The first thing that came into my mind was to get into the water,” Dominic told CNN. “We didn’t have time to think, her head was barely above the water and we could see her sinking more down every second. We didn’t think about the risks, we had to get her out.”

                Heroes will do as heroes do, and hoisting her up onto their shoulders, Dom and Joseph got her ashore, where emergency services arriving at someone else’s call performed first aid and rushed her to the hospital.

                Floodwaters are no conditions to be swimming in. There can be sewage runoff, loose chemicals, downed power lines charging the current with electricity, or physical debris such as manhole covers that have been lifted out of their sockets by the force of the water.

                Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Jenkins described the boys’ act as heroic and brave, as did Dominic’s mom, who had been calling her son for some time before and was growing nervous.

                She sent her husband, Dom’s father, to check on his position, but when he arrived he saw ambulances and firetrucks from the call that was meant to rescue the young woman.

                “I thought of the worst, he’s on a bike and people weren’t paying attention and my fear was he was going to pull up and see our son on the ground,” said Mrs. Viet. “But then he saw them on their bikes heading back to their friend’s house, and I got a text from Dominic saying ‘Coming home soon, just saved a woman’s life Mom.'”

                Oh Mom… how about you have a little faith?

                Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant acted with bravery that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest honor.

                On Friday, Ralph Puckett, Jr. was hosted at the White House where he received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. government’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.

                Ralph’s first response was to ask, “Why all the fuss? Can’t they just mail it to me?”

                But, after his lifetime of service to the nation, President Joe Biden said at the medal ceremony, “Rather than mail it to you, I would’ve walked it to you.”

                Ralph’s wife of 68 years, Jeannie Puckett, was in the audience, too, as Biden described how the couple met—while the brave Army Ranger was recovering from his wounds.

                They were married two years to the day after the battle in November, 1950, for which he was honored this week with the following citation: “For acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the commander 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company…”

                51 of Puckett’s Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out in a daylight attack to take Hill 205, just 60 miles from the border with China, which drew mortar, machine gun, and small-arms fire against them. First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in their offensive.

                To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire.

                “Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position, with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” continued the citation.

                When the Rangers finally reached the top of the hill, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn’t nearly over.

                “During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett.”

                Even though Puckett’s Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one, five attacks by a battalion-strength enemy were repulsed.

                During the first wave, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support. Over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.

                “He repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole, to check the company’s perimeter and to distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers.”

                Extraordinary selflessness above and beyond the call
                When the enemy launched a sixth attack, two mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting “grievous wounds” in both his feet, his backside, his left arm and shoulder.

                “Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy.

                Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy-controlled hill.

                First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

                First Time a Foreign Leader Attended This Ceremony
                Biden said in his remarks, “Korea is sometimes called the “Forgotten War.” But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett’s command — they’ll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.”

                “And the people of the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the President of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before.”

                President Moon said, “I learned that I’m the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.

                “Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean War… Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea.”

                “From the ashes of the Korean War, we rose, we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea’s peace and freedom. And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.”

                Puckett’s military service did not end in the Korean War. He also served in the Vietnam War, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars, adding to his five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.

                Visionaries are often accused of being a little mad. Even by their wives. Such was the case of Laungi, a resident of India’s drought-blighted Gaya district in the eastern state of Bihar.

                Loungi Bhuiya had become increasingly distraught as more and more farmers—including four of his own sons—left Kolithwa for greener pastures. Taking a leaf from Don Quixote, Bhuiyan was determined not only to dream an impossible dream but to make that dream come true by single-handedly bringing water to his village in hopes of transforming the barren land into arable acreage.

                Inspired by the earlier exploits of “Mountain Man” Dashrath Manjh, who, with just a hammer and chisel, spent 22 years carving a road through the mountain near the village Gehlaur from 1960 to 1982, Bhuiya set out to dig an irrigation canal by hand to the closest water source in the Bangetha Hills.

                “I had heard about him and I thought if he can do it, why can’t I?” Bhuiya told Al Jazeera. “They all thought I was mad.”

                “He decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village,” Village leader Vishnupat Bhokta told the Tribune of India.

                “The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”

                Despite the teasing from his family and fellow villagers, the now 70-year-old Bhuiya toiled every day to make the four-foot-wide by three-foot-deep canal a reality. It took him nearly 30 years to accomplish his goal, but now everyone is benefitting from the fruits of his decades’ long labors.

                Bhuiya, whose reputation as a neighborhood eccentric has since been transformed into local hero, was recently rewarded for his efforts with a brand-new Mahindra tractor, which will be used to expand the canal.

                Of course, when Quixote creator Miguel de Cervantes wrote: “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical may be madness. To surrender dreams, this may be madness… Maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be,” he wasn’t referring to Bhuiya—but he just as well might have been.

                My friend and I were at the Coliseum to see the Raiders play the Tennessee Titans. After the game, as we were heading out, someone’s phone fell and smashed near us, and then a bunch of people started pointing up. There was a woman up there on the edge of the railing. I turned to Glenn and said, “Do you think she’s gonna jump?” He said, “Oh, boy, she’s falling as we speak."
                It’s about a four-story drop from where she fell, and — without thinking — I just put my arms out as she came toward me. Listen, I was in the Marines, and even though that was 40-some years ago, I still think like a Marine; fortunately, I still react like one once in a while. She leveled out flat as she hit my arms, and bounced off me and fell about four feet away. I fell to the ground, too, from the impact, and I blacked out for a minute. When I came to, Glenn was holding up fingers and saying, “How many do you see?” I was OK. The woman was alive but was in a coma for a while and had brain surgery. She later told me she was very grateful — they call her Miracle Girl. But what bothered me was that I didn’t do a better job of saving her. I couldn’t really latch on to her.

                It was 5 a.m. when I heard somebody screaming, “Help! It’s a bear!” I opened my front door, and there was a 275-pound polar bear sitting on its haunches with a woman in its mouth, waving her around like a rag doll. I thought to myself, I’ve got no weapon or anything. Then I saw my shovel sitting there and found myself going to get it. Once I picked it up, I thought, Well, am I going to do anything, or is that woman going to die? So down the steps I went. 
                When I got over there, I stepped up and hit the bear in the eye. I’d heard this is the best way to fight a bear. He let go of the woman, and she ran into my house. The bear reached out and grabbed ahold of me, and the mauling was on. He tore off my right ear, and I was waiting for him to bite me again. A neighbor fired a shotgun, but it didn’t do any good, so he jumped into his truck and gunned it toward us. I was on my belly on the ground, watching this vehicle speeding our way, and it stopped about two feet away before the bear let me go.

                I spent seven days in the hospital. They worked on me for four hours one day, to staple my wounds, and then for four hours the next day, putting my ear back on. So I came out of it pretty good.

                I never saw myself as a hero and still don’t. You’re dealt a situation, and you either respond or you don’t do anything. People say, “Would you have done anything differently?” I haven’t the faintest idea. The only thing I could think was, If I don’t do anything, she’s not going to make it.

                The crash woke me up. Just after midnight, on a very windy Sunday last October, I heard a very loud noise, and it was a large fir tree falling into my yard from the neighbor’s yard. It crushed a greenhouse and took down the tip of a power line as it landed. I’ve been in my house almost 50 years and know how much damage wind and trees can do, but as I was coming downstairs and glanced outside, I was horrified to see brilliant flames outside my window, way up over my head.

                I live alone­ — my husband died six years ago — and I thought, I have to call 911. But there was no time. I thought, This could go everywhere. It could burn the whole hill. I threw on something over my nightgown, raced outside, grabbed a hose and started spraying water as hard as I could. The wind had already spread the flames to a live oak and then to some blackberry vines on the edge of my driveway. It was really howling now, and I could feel the heat, but I just braced myself and kept on squirting.

                This must have gone on for five minutes, but it felt like an hour. An architect neighbor smelled smoke and ran over to help. Then the couple across the driveway came, and someone called the fire department. When the fire trucks arrived, they yelled at us to move back, but I couldn’t stop. I said, “We have to keep water on this fire.”

                I had no idea I had done anything special. People I never met were knocking on my front door the next day, saying, “You’re a hero. You saved the hill.” But I was just the first responder. I saw what I saw, and I took action.

                Thousands of people lost everything that night in other parts of California. We were fortunate to be spared. But I don’t think it was a miracle. The reality is, my children weren’t there and my husband wasn’t there, and if I wanted to stay in the home I loved, I would have to step up. So I did — but then got a lot of help.

                Once upon a time 10 years ago I had my 15th birthday. My mum woke me up this marvelous morning and told me I had a special delivery at the front door. I dressed myself and ran down the stairs in excitement. When I opened the front door to my surprise I found a big box in the middle of the door way. I jumped in joy and ran inside to see my aunties, uncles, brothers, cousins, grandparents and the rest of my family that were already awake.Everyone wanted me to open the box already but I waited till I put it on the table. Oh my goodness I was about to open it when I heard a noise coming from the box. IT WAS A KITTEN AND A PUPPY. I quickly opened it and found an adorable kitten who was all black with ginger and white patches on her. I named her Precious. Aw how cute was she. After that I carefully took my puppy out of the box and held him. He was a little tiny black and white dog with a few patches on him. I chose to name him terror because he tore the box open before I got him out. My family told me that I got my puppy Terror from my male relatives and I got the kitten Precious from my female relatives. The afternoon was here already and I had turned 15 at 12:13PM. My friends came over to celebrate my birthday. When they all got here to my surprise I had found a huge gift from all of them. I opened this card up and found airfares to Sydney and to go to Palm Beach to meet my inspirations, the cast of home and away. " OH MY GOODNESS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY EVER I CAN'T BELIEVE IT" We all went out and had an amazing time. That isn't all you get Jessica. " We are all going out tomorrow before you leave to Sydney with all of your family. "WHAT YOU MEAN I AM LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT WITH MY FAMILY TO GO ON AN AEROPLANE"? "YEP YOU GOT IT RIGHT GIRL". "SEE THIS IS LEGIT THE BEST DAY EVER"I exclaimed. "WE HAVE ALSO GOT YOU TICKETS TO MEET AND GREET ONE DIRECTION AND YOU WILL BE STAYING IN THE SAME HOTEL AS THEM". "WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "I LOVE YOU GIRLS SO MUCH YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME". "Well girly you and your family better start packing because you leave tomorrow night and we are all going out tomorrow to celebrate your 15th". "Alright"! Guess what Jessica. "What"? "That isn't it we haven't told you another surprise. "WHAT IS IT"? "WE ARE COMING TO Sydney ASWELL AS YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF. SO IS TERROR AND PRECIOUS"? "AHHHHHHHH ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "YEP WHY WOULDN'T WE BE"? "WHERE IS PRECIOUS AND TERROR GOING TO STAY"? "WITH YOU". "TERROR AND PRECIOUS ARE STAYING WITH YOU AND WE FLY OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON JETSTAR JQ1314 AT 9:00PM."WHEN WE GET TO SYDNEY EVERYONE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT AND EVERYTHING". The day came and I was super excited. at about 10:30PM we arrived at Sydney airport and it felt so good to be in my favorite place.

                Life is full of unexpected surprises. There are many opportunities when one can secretly wish for something exciting to happen – something out of the ordinary. The real surprise is when the wish unexpectedly comes true. I never believed that something like this could ever happen to me; such a thing that would make me stop and look back at the events in awe. I think you would agree that something as simple as being lost in the forest for less than ten minutes should have no influence on my life. If you do agree, that makes both of us wrong.

                Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Coote’s Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

                As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. That’s when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that can’t be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

                I think that another reason that I felt carefree was because my parents didn’t panic. They took the situation under control and headed for any open area in hopes to find a map (many of these maps were found throughout the grounds, telling you where you were). From my point of view, at the time, it seemed as if they were excited as I was about losing our way. In the end, it only took my parents ten minutes to find such a map and we were back on the trail in no time.

                An experience like this made me think about my place in life. I’m the type who loves seeking out adventures. When we were lost, I realized that I had everything I would ever need with me – my family. They’ve always supported me in everything I do. This experience made me realize that families need to stick together; you don’t realize how much you need them until, for a moment, you think they’ll be the last people you see for the rest of your life.

                It’s incredible how much a simple thing like being lost in a forest for ten minutes will affect your outlook on life. Things like not being able to find your way back to where you came from make you appreciate the little things in life. Looking back on the day, I realize now that it was fate. Moments like that are few and far between and should be taken as a lesson. Surprises like this were, and always will be, an unexpected gift for all.

My Mom told that our neighbour, Shanti Bhabhi had given birth to a little fairy, the lakshmi of the home, a baby girl. But suddenly this happiness curve on my face disappeared with the thought of her husband. Shanti's husband, Raju bhaiya who was not a good man. A drunkard by nature, he had never provided that space to his wife and his male chauvinism was fiercely aggressive. I once heard his words in the street to the little daughter of our neighbours that studying and playing doesn't suit girls. They are meant for bangles and making rotis, just like a common male chauvinist. The prevailing awareness of the maltreatment of girls in the media, shook me again. I just wished that this liitle fairy should not face such a treatment and should be brought up on an equality basis with the sons of the same house. But somewhere in the heart the thought took place so firmly that I went to Shanti Bhabhi's house and what I saw next was unbelievable. I saw Raju Bhaiya with his little daughter in his hands and saying that he wished to grew his daughter with all the best education that he can afford. The love and incredibility of the moment rolled down tears from my eyes.

                After a long bout with Parkinson’s, my Grandmother had passed. And as a pleasant surprise, I was in the will. I had inherited her car, and the ghost that came in the car. That’s right. Grandma’s car was haunted. Her 1980 Chevy Citation was haunted.

                I was surprised in so many ways. Hell, when I first turned the key I didn’t think that the thing would even start, let alone be haunted. It was an aged hunk of junk, and hadn’t seen much use in the past twenty years. And then when I saw the little figure creeping along the dash, I started to wonder if this was why she chose to stop driving it; and not because of the glaucoma.

                I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find something that wasn’t static, when it came. It was tiny, the size of my hand. It was the classic ghost. Literally, the classic ghost. In a little white sheet (a handkerchief, really) with tiny holes where the eyes and mouth would be. I couldn’t see any feet beneath the hem of the shroud, but it seemed to have tiny little hands poking up as it levitated towards me. And as it came drifting along, it was making a little ethereal ‘whooooooo’ sound at me.

                It was freaking adorable.

                I mean, come on. It was like a kindergarten Halloween decoration had come to life and came to visit. It was so little! It was smaller than the rat I had when I was in college. It was smaller than my breakfast sandwich. I wanted to pet it.

                I suppose in retrospect, yeah. I should have been a little more respectful. Maybe taken it a little bit more seriously. Seeing visible proof of the afterlife, actual confirmation of existence after death… well, that’s serious stuff. And, one would think, deserved more respect than the delirious giggles I wasn’t holding back.

                I think even the little ghost was actually taken aback by this. It stopped mid-‘whoo’ and kind of stared at me. It just drifted in place, bobbing like a floater in the corner of your eye.

                And there I sat, snickering and crouched back against the driver’s side door of the old Citation. The car still smelled like Vicks and old menthol cigarettes, the defining scents of my dear old Grandma.

                Was this Grandpa, maybe? Could it be? My mind raced. Grandma never spoke much of her ex-husband, just that he was a son of a bitch and that he had gotten his ‘just desserts’. Did his ‘just desserts’ involve being murdered and cursed to haunt a handkerchief on his jilted wife’s dashboard? But then I remembered mom saying that her dad had just jumped ship and moved to Iowa, where he had died in 1979.

                So my theory was obviously sunk. I peered at the little thing, static from the dusty old radio an idle buzz in the back of my mind. The ghost just bobbed in the warm air beneath the windshield, occasionally emitting little ‘Whooo’s!’ at me. I didn’t think it was trying to scare me anymore.

                Then a much more troubling idea occurred to me. What if this thing was my grandmother? Oh, now that’s a terrible thought. I couldn’t think of a worse fate than being doomed to spend the rest of eternity haunting the interior of a mid-80’s compact.

                And worse, if this was my Grandma’s spirit then I’d feel especially guilty taking the Citation to the junkyard to sell for parts.

                I had to know. I sat in thought for a moment, then came to a resolution. I was going to see exactly who — or what — this thing really was. I sat up in the drivers seat, steeled myself. I reached out towards the little ghost with my fingers trembling.

                I won’t lie to you, I was terrified. At first I thought the whole thing was kind of funny, this little cutesy ghost the size of half a donut. But the prospect of what could be under that little white sheet, that scared the hell out of me. I didn’t want to see my undead Grandma, pale and shrunken and horribly shriveled after death. I wanted Grandma to be in heaven with Great-Uncle Al, and all of her dogs, and her one cat that I had liked.

                As I slowly reached out my shaking hand, it actually reached out to me a little bit. I was startled, and snatched my hand back a little bit. But I focused, and mentally pushed my hand forward again. I had to know.

                I yanked up the little white sheet with my eyes shut tight, and after a second I slowly eased them open so that I could see who — what — it was.

                I didn’t know the guy.

                I ended up making four hundred bucks at the junkyard. Which was another pleasant surprise

                I had got the money by work done at home, out of office hours. It came to four pounds altogether. At first I thought I would use it to discharge a part of our debt to Eliza’s mother. But it was very possible that she would send it back again, in which case the pence spent on the postal orders would be wasted, and I am not a man that wastes pennies. Also, it was not absolutely certain that she would send it back. I sent her a long letter instead–my long letters are almost her only intellectual pleasure. As for the four pounds, I reserved two for myself, for any incidental expenses, and decided to give two to Eliza. I did not mean simply to hand them to her, but to get up something in the way of a pleasant surprise.

                I had tried something of the kind before. Eliza once asked me for six shillings for a new tea-tray that she had seen. I went and stood behind her chair, and said, “No, dear, I couldn’t think of it,” at the same time dropping the six shillings down the back of her neck. Eliza said it was a pity I couldn’t give her six shillings for a tea-tray without compelling her to go up-stairs and undress at nine o’clock in the morning. It was not a success.

                However, I had more than one idea in my head. This time I thought I would first find out if there was anything she wanted.

                So on Sunday at tea-time I said, not as if I were meaning anything in particular, “Is there anything you want, Eliza?”

                “Yes,” she said; “I want a general who’ll go to bed at half-past nine and get up at half-past five. If they’d only do that, that’s all I ask.”

                “You will pardon me, Eliza,” I said, “but you are not speaking correctly. You said that was all that you asked. What you meant—-“

                “Do you know what I meant?”

                “I flatter myself that I know precisely—-“

                “Then if you know precisely what I meant, I must have spoken accurately.”

                But as we went to church I discovered that she wanted a new jacket. Her own was trimmed rabbit, and had been good, but the fur had gone bald in places.

                * * * * *

                Next morning I wrote on a sheet of note-paper, “To buy a new jacket. With your husband’s love.” I folded the two sovereigns up in this, and dropped the packet into the pocket of Eliza’s old jacket, as it hung in the wardrobe, not telling her what I had done. My idea was that she would put on the jacket to go out shopping in the morning, and putting her hand in the pocket, get a pleasant surprise. As I was leaving for town, she asked me why I kept on smiling so mysteriously. I replied, “Perhaps you, too, will smile before the day is over.”

                On my return I found Eliza at the front door. “Come and look,” she said, cheerfully. “I have got a pleasant surprise for you.” She flung open the drawing-room door, and pointed. In the middle of the table stood a spiraea, a most handsome and graceful plant. It stood in one of the best saucers, with some coloured paper round the pot, and the general effect was very good. I at once guessed that she had bought it for me with the change from my present to her, and thought it showed very good feeling in her.

                “I hope you have not given too much for this,” I said.

                “I didn’t give any money for it.”

                “I don’t understand.”

                “Well, you must know I had a present this morning.”

                “Of course I know.”

                “Did mother tell you? Yes, she has sent me a beautiful new jacket. Then a man came round with a barrow of plants, and he said he didn’t want money if I had any clothes to spare. So I gave him my old worn-out jacket for this spiraea, and—-“
                I remembered that I had seen the man with the barrow farther down the street.

                “Excuse me for one moment, Eliza,” I said, and dashed out after him.

                * * * * *

                He was a big, red-faced man, and he made no difficulty about it at all.

                “Yes,” he said, “I bought that jacket, gov’ner, and I don’t deny it. There it is at the bottom of my bundle, and I ain’t even looked at it since. Nor I ain’t goin’ to look now. You say there was two suvreigns in the pocket. A gent like you don’t want to swindle a common man like me. If you say the two suvreigns was there, then they’re there now, and I can return yer two pound out o’ my own, in a suttunty of gettin’ ’em back out o’ the jacket pocket. Bless yer! I knows an honest man when I sees one.”

                With these words he drew the money from his own waistcoat pocket, and handed it to me. I took it with some reluctance.

                “Hadn’t you better make quite certain—-“

                “Not a bit,” says he. “If them suvreigns were there when the jacket were ‘anded to me, they is there now. I could see as you was a man to be trusted, otherwise I’d ‘ave undone the bundle and searched long afore this.”

                * * * * *

                “What have you been doing?” said Eliza, on my return.

                “Never mind. Your mother has given you a new jacket. Let me have the pleasure of giving you a new hat.” I pressed the two coins into her palm.

                She looked at them, and said, “You can’t get a hat for a halfpenny, you know, dear. What did you rush out for just now? And why did you have these two farthings gilded? You’ll be mistaking them for sovereigns, if you’re not careful. Were you trying to take me in?”

                I did not quite see what to say for the moment, and so I took her suggestion. I explained that it was a joke.

                “You don’t look much as if you were joking.”

                “But I was. I suppose I ought to know if any man does. However, Eliza, if you want a new hat, anything up to half a sovereign, you’ve only to say it.”

                She said it, thanked me, and asked me to come and help her water the spiraea.

                “It’s such a shapely spiraea,” she said.

                “Yes,” I answered sadly, “it’s a regular plant.” And so it was, though I had not been intending what the French call a double entendre at the time

                “Surprises are beautiful because they come without waiting.” Not so true for Nancy though. She was sure her sister was planning a surprise for her birthday. Pulling open the pink pastel curtains of her bedroom window,  she hungrily drank in the fresh morning air. Her eyes were laced with longing. A soft smile slid across her lips which were otherwise dry with sadness and coated with grief.  Nancy was turning 30 today. “Keep calm. It’s only your 30th birthday”. Humming her favourite song in her head, her lips pursed in, Nancy ran her fingers over her thin wavy short hair. No a strand of grey! Many of her friends were already showing mini zebra stripes in their heads. But, not her! Thank goodness for that.

                She quickly glanced at the mirror and looked away. She never liked looking at the mirror. It always reminded her of what she was not. “Life is just a mirror and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you.” Wally “famous” Amos. Turning her face away from the mirror like it was an enemy on the prowl, a single glossy tear flowed down her cheek. Clutching the ends of her dress, she poured them back in again. She was not going to think of the past and all that it had done to her. She held her palms up and looked at them. Shrivelled walnuts were what they looked like. Lifeless, yet useful. “Nothing worth having, comes easy.”

                All these years she had worked at different factories, clothes, metals, chemicals, shoe, scrubbed the floors at big hotels where perfumed men and women floated easily.  Ever since their parents died, her only goal was to educate Kate, her younger sister. Her emotions came running back to the present. Quickly, she wiped her dried tears and rushed some chirpy cheer on her face. She paced to the door and back.

                “A sister is a little bit of childhood that can never be lost.” Kate was her dream, her hope, her happiness. The gleam of a thousand stars shone on her face as she thought of her sister. Her precious possession. She meant everything to her. She was all she had. Kate shined liked a diamond in a heap of coal. She was an outstanding student and an obedient younger sister. And today, Nancy was sure Kate would surprise her like she did every year. Nancy’s nostrils swelled open in anticipation of the sweet aroma of the freshly baked chocolate cake that would welcome her. Her tongue was eager to lick up the soft, brown cream and her teeth were ready to bite into Kate’s inviting delicacy. She stretched her ears with her hands to hear the sound of Kate’s footsteps coming towards her. She clapped her hands and giggled at her own act of childishness.
                She waited and waited.

                It seemed like an endless wait and a tide of emotions were rushing through Nancy. Finally, she heard her younger sister approaching her room. Her eyes lit up, her steps turned into a spring and her heart grew all  bouncy. She sniffed the air to catch a whiff of the chocolate cake but it was missing. Maybe it was not chocolate flavour this time, she imagined with pride intruding her thoughts. Her sister was all grown up now. She could surprise her with something else.

                Kate walked into her room empty handed. No cake, no flowers, no package wrapped in shiny golden paper, tied with red ribbons. The excitement dissolved from Nancy’s face. Her face looked like a blank, crumpled, white page. Kate was smiling. She could win the world with the radiance of her smile. She gave her sister a tight hug. “Happy birthday” said Kate. Nancy loosened herself from the warm embrace and looked at her sister. “Thank you” she said, smiling coldly. “And here’s your gift” Kate handed her a brown envelope. Nancy’s eyebrows shot up like mountain peaks and her eyes were flooded with questions.

                “Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love is by far the truest type of love. This is your admission letter to the community college. I want you to pick up from where you left.”

                Nancy’s eyes grew moist and her trembling hands were silenced by Kate’s firm grip over them. Nancy shut her eyes tight and let her tears flow as she folded her hands in prayer. Kate’s words sparkled with happiness and shined with guilt as she said “You deserve much more my dear sister, but this is all I can give you.”

                I was waiting for my birthday and thinking about how I wished my birthday to be. I visualised and wished that I would get some big surprise as a birthday gift from the Universe and then I completely forgot about it. But just 15 days before my birthday I was diagnosed with Typhoid. On the day of my birthday I was very weak, bedridden and taking my pills and eating only boiled food. I was unable to talk over the phone so no one called me and my family thought it was not appropriate to bring me cake as I was unable to eat it. It was my birthday evening and I was at home feeling dull.

                The Universe never forgets your wish, and it did not forget mine either, so then it happened. All my friends came over to my place and gave me a big birthday surprise! They brought the cake and a gift which was a branded Jacket, which was also one of my wishes. I had an awesome time with them and felt so happy.

                The Secret is so true and the Universe brings everything you wish for.

                One day a professor entered the classroom and asked his students to prepare for a surprise test. They waited anxiously at their desks for the test to begin. The professor handed out the question paper, with the text facing down as usual.
                
                Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no questions....just a black dot in the center of the page. The professor seeing the expression on everyone's face, told them the following: "I want you to write what you see there."
                
                The students confused, got started on the inexplicable task. At the end of the class, the professor took all the answer papers and started reading each one of them aloud in front of all the students. All of them with no exceptions, described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc. etc. etc.
                
                After all had been read, the classroom silent, the professor began to explain: "I am not going to grade you on this; I just wanted to give you something to think about. No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.
                
                Our life is a gift given to us by God, with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature renewing itself everyday, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see everyday.
                
                However we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on.
                
                The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life. Enjoy each one of your blessings, each moment that life gives you. Be happy and live a life filled with LOVE,"

                Liz was just about finished wrapping up the final details for the
                surprise party she was planning for her husband. She had
                been meticulously preparing for this event, designing every aspect
                of the party from the invitations to the food, and she was very excited
                about it.
                Family members whom Guermo hadn’t seen in years were flying in from Peru in
                a few days. Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
                from various places across the country. The caterer and band were set.
                The best part for Liz: she knew Guermo did not have a clue about the party. She
                could not wait to see the look on his face when he walked into a big “Surprise!” in
                his own home.
                The party was to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about picking
                relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to their hotel, Guermo
                walked into the kitchen and said, quite certainly, “Sweetheart, I don’t want
                anything special done for my birthday.”
                “What do you mean?” Liz responded nonchalantly, though her heart began to
                pound.
                “I mean that I don’t want a surprise party.”
                “Okay,” Liz said with a shrug. “Not a problem.”
                Liz’s mind raced. There was nothing she could do about Guermo’s request now.
                And, frankly, she didn’t want to. Liz had been planning this for more than a year.
                The party would go off as she intended. She did not want all of her effort to be for
                naught.
                When Guermo came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends,
                he was shocked. Tears filled his eyes. (This response was something Liz had not
                predicted.) Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in nearly 20
                years and family members who had come from Peru just for this evening.
                But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry with his wife. He
                felt ambushed. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like people to
                see him that way. That was why he did not like being surprised.
                Salsa music filled the home of Liz and Guermo. Guests filled up on ceviche, lomo
                soltado and empanadas. Liz whispered “I love you” in Guermo’s ear, they shared
                a kiss, and the two danced the night away.

                Once upon a time a plump old woman name Tante Adela lived in French Canada.  She lived all alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

                One morning she got up very early as it baking day and there was much to do.  She took a load of wood outside to her oven. 

                “Now why would oven door be open?” she said.  She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in.  But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

                The old woman bent over to look in.  When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut. She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

                When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

                At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw the neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

                “Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick!  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Felix.  “Maybe it is your cat.”

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

                “I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

                Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road.  She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross.  After all, three heads are better than two.

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down its back?”

                “Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath.  “Come right away!  There is a skunk in my oven.”

                “A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

                “Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela.  “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

                “You have a point,” said Louis Ross.  “I will come over as soon as I have finished feeding the chickens.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out.  “You must come to my farm.  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Samuel.  “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela.  “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snark?  I don’t think so!”

                “I will come right over,” said Samuel.  “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

                So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help.  By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there.  Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

                “Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

                “I know that!” said Tante Adela.  “The question is, what to do about it?”

                “I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “She will not be able to bake bread in there for a month!” said Madame Roy, and everyone agreed.

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “And it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel.  He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

                “What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross.  “A dog will bark.  Maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

                “If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

                “What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” said someone else.  “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                So this plan was dropped.  No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers.

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                “Oh, woe is me!” wailed Tante Adela. 

                By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk.  And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come.  Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows.  Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn.  And one by one, everyone found a reason to head home.

                At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard.  The young man may be simple-minded, she thought.  Still, who else could she turn to for help?

                “Jules!” she said.  “Jules Martel.  There is a skunk in my oven.  Can you get him out without scaring him?”
                stop
                What would you do to try and get the skunk out of the oven?

                Jules nodded his head.  He walked over to the oven.  He opened the door and leaned inside.  He spoke in a low voice.  No one could tell what he was saying.  At last he stepped back.  Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway.  Everyone stepped back a few feet.  The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground.

                Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high.  And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “How did you get him to come out?” said Samuel to Jules.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “What DID you say to it?” said someone else.

                “I just told him,” said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, “that if he stayed in the oven any more, he would begin to smell like Tante Adela’s bread.  And if that happened, none of the other skunks would come near him.”

                “Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “That a low creature like a skunk cares about what others creatures like him think of him.”

                “I suppose all creatures must have some sense of self-respect,” said Alice Roy, “no matter who they are.”  Alice Roy and the others nodded in silence

                In just three days, it will be Christmas. Despite the bright and cheery decorations twinkling in the streets, wreaths on doors, and Christmas trees peeking through windows, Hector doesn't feel one drop of joy or excitement. The magic of Christmas seems to have evaporated this year. People passing one another on the street do not wish each other Happy Holidays, smile, or even make eye contact. They simply rush by with their heads down and eyes straight ahead, their minds preoccupied with their to-do lists and avoiding human interaction. 

                Hector doesn't even feel Christmas Spirit from his own family. This morning, he woke up excited to decorate the family Christmas tree with his mother as they did every year. They had barely started wrapping the lights when the phone rang. "Oh dear, it's Aunt Susan!" Hector's mother exclaimed. "Go on without me. I’ll be back." Hector finished the whole tree by himself by the time his mother was off of the phone with her sister. Later that afternoon, Hector's father cancelled their plans to play basketball together. Even Hector's older brother, Yohan, was too busy playing video games to help Hector make shortbread cookies for the family. 

                Feeling discouraged by the lack of festivity around the village and his home, Hector snuggles up with his most comfortable blanket and lets out an enormous sigh. He turns off the light and falls asleep. 

                That night Hector's Native American grandmother, Tallulah, pays him a visit in his dream. Around eight months ago, she left Hector's family to join the great white falcon in the sky. In her gentle voice, she whispers: “Hector, it's up to you to reinvent the magic of Christmas. You can change things. Search in your heart and you’ll find the solution.”

                When he wakes up, Hector cannot stop thinking about his dream. “Reinvent the magic of Christmas,” Tallulah said. He thinks about her words and jots down ideas on a sheet of paper, but crosses them out one by one. Suddenly, his face lights up.

                After lunch, Hector hangs a “do not disturb” sign on the door of his bedroom, closes the curtains, and sits down in his laboratory. This little corner of his room is equipped with a big lamp, magnifying glass, and all the materials from the chemistry set his parents got him for his birthday.

                All afternoon, Hector experiments with various combinations of Christmas ingredients. He melts candy canes and spices into little bowls, then mixes them with some of the plant oils that his grandmother Tallulah handed down to him. The liquid smells pepper-minty and delicious, and Hector feels a rush of optimism. Perhaps this is it! He takes the bowl in his hand and offers a sniff to Zephir, his big striped cat. Zephir's first sniff sends him into a spiral of sneezes. He sniffs the potion once more, then lies down on his back with his feet directly in the air. Hmmmm. Must need some work, thinks Hector. He adjusts the quantities, replaces some of the peppermint with other Christmas ingredients. He looks at Zephir and lets out a joyful shout. 

                Licorice, chocolate chips, cinnamon, star anise powder, three drops of Ayahuasca, a drop of the small seed of Nahele, and two drops of moonflower. He discovered the Christmas Spirit elixir formula!

                Using colored paper from his mother’s desk, Hector cuts, folds, and glues. He makes thirty red, green, blue, yellow, and purple envelopes into which he carefully applies two drops of Christmas Spirit elixir. On each card, he places a sticker of a little elf with a sentence written in capital letters.

                The next day after lunch, Hector gets on his bike. Along each street in the village, he slips a colored envelope under the door of the first house on both the left and right side of every street. Once he finishes all his rounds, Hector returns home. He sits down on his bed and waits. When it's 5 o’clock, he tip-toes downstairs, checks to make sure that no one is looking, then quietly opens the front door and slips outside. Then Hector then walks back into the house, pretending to have just returned home and discovered the little red letter. “Mom, Dad, Yohan, come quick!” He calls. 

                When all four of them are standing together in the living room, Hector reads the label aloud. “Open this letter as a family. After opening me, you should close me again and slip me under the door of the neighbor to your right.”

                The family bubbles with curiosity. Hector's mother grabs the envelope and opens it. A strong scent of chocolate, spice, and incense floats across the living room. Hector's parents and brother stand completely still as the delicious scent surrounds them. Suddenly they begin to move, their eyes sparkling, large smiles slowing spreading across their faces. Hector's father begins to dance, grabbing Hector's mother's hand and twirling her to music only they can hear. They both hum and looking lovingly into one another's eyes. Yohan grabs Hector and lifts him above his head, then begins to spin him around as he used to do when Hector was little. 

                “How about we take the scooters to go look at some Christmas decorations around town?” Hector's mother blurts out, smiling from ear to ear. 

                The family bundles themselves in hats and scarves and coats and rush outside. His brother takes the red scooter, and his father the blue one.

                “Come on, princess, get into my carriage.” Hector's father says to Hector's mother. 

                “Wait!” his mother says. She runs back into the house and grabs the red envelope. When she comes out into the cold again, her husband and two sons are circling around on their scooters. 

                Hector's mother runs across the lawn and stuffs the letter underneath the neighbor's door. She rings doorbell three times and shouts, “Merry Christmas!”

                Then all four of them speed down the street, Hector holding on to his big brother's waist and Hector's mother holding onto Hector's father. Both scooters slide over a large patch of ice, then shoot quickly into a pile of snow. Hector's parents roar with laughter. Hector holds his brother tight.

                Everywhere they go, the village is topsy-turvy. Hector chuckles to himself. His elixir is working! Mrs. Gari and Mrs. Dubois have finally stopped arguing and are building a snowman together, their cheeks rosy with laughter.  The mailman has switched out his black coat for a bright red one. His mailbag filled with candy, and he shouts "Merry Christmas!" as he slings sweet treats out to everyone he passes. On Lilas Street, the family joins an enormous snowball fight. Grown-ups and children alike launch snowballs at one another. Everyone is dodging, jumping, laughing and rolling. On Cerfs Street, a group is playing hide-and-seek among the piles of snow they were once preoccupied with removing from their walkways. Others are sledding, and others are blowing up balloons and releasing them into the chilly afternoon air. Delicious aromas of hot chestnuts, crepes, and nougat float throughout the village. At the large church down the hill, the carousel is all lit up and spinning around. Mostly adults are on it and bob up and down to the happy sound of the music. Hector's father and mother rush over to the merry-go-round. Hector spots his teacher on the ride, sitting in a big fire truck. Hector waves to him with a huge smile.

                His brother walks towards him holding two huge servings of cotton candy. They both sit down on the bench across from the dazzling Christmas tree. While enjoying his treat, Hector smiles. In all the eyes that meet his, there is that little spark that shines, a little spark of happiness that tastes like childhood. “Thank you, Tallulah,” he whispers quietly.

                Today is Ruby’s eighth birthday. Ruby does not know that her parents have arranged a circus party at her grandparents' house. Many of Ruby’s friends are invited to the party. Her little brother John helped his mum make the cake and the cupcakes.

                When Ruby woke up, she yawned. “It’s my birthday today,” she said. She ran down from her room into the kitchen. When Ruby’s mum heard her she hid the cake and the cupcakes. “Happy Birthday Ruby, we are going to take you to a surprise outing today.” “Yes!” Ruby cried, she was so excited.

                Ruby ran to her room and put on her gold sparkly dress, her gold sparkly shoes and a gold headband. She wore her favourite butterfly necklace. It was then time to go.

                Ruby hopped into the car and was amazed as there were balloons and streamers, and her seat was decorated in gold sparkles like a throne. Ruby wondered where her mum, dad and brother were taking her. As she looked outside the window she saw a beautiful rainbow in the bright blue sky, twinkling through the branches. “Hang on a minute,” Ruby said when the car stopped. "We are at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.” Grandma and Grandpa greeted Ruby outside the house. “Happy Birthday Ruby, please come inside,” they said.

                As Ruby walked inside the house she saw steamers and balloons everywhere. Ruby then walked into the backyard and was startled when she saw a big red tent with blue and yellow spots. “What is that? Oh my goodness, it’s a circus,” she cried. She walked into the tent and gasped as she saw many of her school friends. She saw Abigail, Amelia, Ella, Zara, Holly, Hannah, Abby, Elie, Cameron, Monique, Amy, Stephanie, Olivia, Maddison, Brianna, Isabella and her bestfriend Grace. They were all so excited to see Ruby.

                Ruby and her friends ran outside and started playing with her grandparents' dog, Rusty. Rusty was a nice puppy dog that didn’t bite anyone but loved to bite the red striped socks on the washing line.

                The big Jacaranda tree was decorated with sparkly streamers. Under the tree there was a picnic blanket set up with a plate of sandwiches for her and her friends. They all sat together and enjoyed their lunch. Once they finished they heard Grandma call out, “Its time for the circus.” They ran into the tent.

                Inside the tent they saw Grandma dressed as an Acrobat and Grandpa was dressed like a Ringmaster. They started to giggle. A man then walked into the tent with two ponies. Grandpa and the man helped all the children have turns riding on the ponies. After everyone had a turn on the pony, a lady walked in with a big trapeze. The lady helped Grandma swing on the trapeze. Everybody cheered and clapped for Grandma. Then everyone had a turn on the trapeze. They were having a wonderful time.

                When it was time to cut the cake, they all went outside where they saw a big pink circus cake set up on a table under the sparkly tree. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to Ruby. They all had a piece of cake and cupcakes with ice-cream.

                When everyone had left, Ruby ran up to her mum, dad, brother, grandma and grandpa and told them that it was the best birthday she had every had and gave them lots of hugs and kisses.

            story2="""About six months ago, the supervisor of one of my teams left. Since all my other managers were very busy, I stepped in to oversee the team operationally. I was rather rusty and there were many challenges in the team that we needed to conquer and I was a bit overwhelmed. But more about that another one.

                Lisa was a relatively new team member. She was the quiet one in team meetings, slow in adapting to changes and somewhat lacking confidence in her abilities. Due to the changes in the team, I really needed her to step up and expand the scope of her activities. I started to progressively give her new tasks so as not to overwhelm her. However, she kept showing silent or sometimes not so silent resistance to any new activity type, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated.

                After one particularly aggravating incident when she called in sick 30 min after I gave her a new task, I knew we could no longer continue this way. I was planning to have a very tough talk with her and tell her off.

                Fortunately, just then, the Harvard Business Review’s “Why leading with compassion is a better managerial tactic than toughness” article came to me in one of a multitude of serendipitous moments that are sprinkled through my life. It reminded me of something that I already knew well but had for a moment, forgotten in my anger – compassion in leadership promotes employee trust and loyalty.

                With my regained balance, I called her and we started talking. It was still a difficult conversation centered around two areas – what are the reasons for her resistance and what she wants to achieve in our team. Lisa shared that she was a perfectionist and had a strong fear of not completing her tasks as per my expectations and the training she received for her new activities was not sufficient to make her feel confident. She also complained that her current workload does not allow her to take on anything new (which was partially true). She had big ambitions for professional growth, but she did not seem to make the connection that to achieve them, she would need to keep expanding her responsibilities and learning new things. I directed the conversation there and clearly told her that she could not expect growth within my team unless she steps up. It was a stern message to deliver, and I am sure – a difficult one to hear.

                After the conversation, I arranged additional training for her and redistributed some of her work, but honestly, I was not sure she would make it. She had to overcome a deeply instilled fear of failure, and I could not predict whether she would manage.

                Time passed, their new supervisor joined and I stepped back. I could not observe Lisa’s progress very closely anymore, but I noticed that she is taking on more and more responsibilities. I was hesitant to broach the subject with her because I was afraid I would jinx her headway.

                Until a couple of weeks ago, when we had our regular skip-level meeting and she started the conversation with, “Marta, I have been waiting for this conversation. I wanted to tell you that I am not afraid of new things anymore. I realized that the only way you develop is by learning new things. And now when there is a new task, I just go, “bring it on.””

                Let me tell you – I did not stop smiling for three days after that. Fear of failure is one of the most crippling emotions one can experience. And I should know – I have been battling it all my life. But Lisa had managed to shift her focus to her desire for success instead and to keep moving forward. I see a bright future for her in our team.

                Vulnerability is risky on many levels. And it does not help that as managers, we are often taught that vulnerability is a sign of weakness and can damage our professional reputation. Melinda was brought up as a leader in precisely that way. She thought she should focus all work interactions entirely on operational tasks, issues and resolutions. While she gladly accepts others’ vulnerability and is very attuned to their emotions, sharing her own goes against her professional image of herself.

                This approach has brought her excellent results and much success. Still, over time she started realizing that she is not getting everything she needed from her relationships with her manager, her team and her colleagues. She often felt misunderstood and increasingly unhappy.

                Progressively, despite her conditioning to always seem in control and never talk about her own emotions and needs, she started realizing that she would never achieve full job satisfaction unless she opened up. And since this required a great leap of courage, she did it in one big move – in the course of one week, she had meetings with her manager, her team and some of her stakeholders. During those meetings, she, for the first time, managed to express her own feelings and intimate thoughts about her work relationships and her job. She talked about the issues she struggled with and showed up as a human being and not just a manager and professional.

                Since this is not a fairy tale, I cannot lie that everything magically changed after those meetings and now all those relationships are perfect and completely satisfactory for her. But she did open doors for conversations that would never be possible before, and that could eventually lead her to a place of comfort and trust.

                Now, I am often annoyed at people who quote their children and find some profound and deep meaning in everything the kid does or says. But my son is special and very wise (ask anyone who knows him).

                Three years ago, he and his friends encountered an aggressive dog and overnight, he was utterly terrified of anything with a tail. He would cross the street if he would see even a puppy approaching and if a dog got near him, he would scream and jump a mile high.

                This went on for a few months and then Benton appeared. Benton was a small white dog with a brown tail and was my son’s first imaginary friend (he read this and said that Benton was brown with a white rump, but that is not how I remember it). Later he had others too – a cat, a horse, a tiger, an invisible boy. At some point, they went up to eight and it was pretty crowded at home. But Benton was the first one and stayed with us the longest. My son was able to explain what the dog was currently doing at any given moment, and we talked about him often. We even wrote one and a half books about him (I got lazy after that).

                Over time, when we met a dog, after the initial scream, he would look at it and start finding similarities with Benton and show more and more interest in dogs. Two years after Benton came into our lives, my son was able to spend time with dogs and even play with them occasionally. He is still not their biggest fan (we are cat people in our house), but he feels quite comfortable with our friends’ very real dog who lives in our shared yard.

                There is a technique widely used in cognitive therapy called desensitization. It involves controlled exposure to anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus, starting with low intensity and increasing it gradually. I had tried to do that with real dogs, but apparently, no matter how slowly I thought I was moving, it was still too much for him. So he decided to start his desensitization himself with something he can bear – an imaginary dog.

                See, I told you he was wise.

                Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.

                One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.

                "A great many times, Marina," answered her Aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment".

                Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?

                "I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened".

                "Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear".

She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this.

                You have just one more chance to prove you can do it”, the words of my instructor echoed and reechoed in my ears as I got into the plane. Fear was a natural thing, I had heard and I had a common fear which a lot of others had: I was afraid of heights. I had been afraid of even looking down from a high building.

                This fear had been with me from as long as I could remember. It was to overcome my crippling fear of heights that I had decided to join the parachute school. I had gone through a vigorous routine to prepare myself for the big moment. Than at the signal to jump, I had shivered and trembled and started screaming in fear. The instructor had taken me by the hand and led me back into the plane. I was the only one that day who had taken off in the plane and landed-instead of jumping out of it in a parachute. As my companions met me at the base they smirked. I could see that even my good friends were uncomfortable in my presence. I was a failure.

                Then my instructor took me aside. He explained that it was not rare to be afraid. The real valor was in facing and overcoming the fear. I nodded and began to engage in self-talk. In the plane I was still doing this. I kept thinking how I was going to go home and face my parents if I did not get my wings. Then I tried to shutout the fear by imagining myself showing them my wings. The time for the jump grew near.

                The instructor placed his arm on my shoulder to reassure me that I could do it. I nodded and swallowed. My mouth felt dry as I felt the fear arising within me, shiver ran down my spines. I began mumbling affirmations again and then it was my turn. “Jump!” I heard the command and hesitated. “Jump!” shouted the instructor again. I thought no further and took the plunge fairly as I had been drilled.”Bravo” I heard my instructor’s voice in my ears. I fell swiftly and then looked up just in time to see the parachute canopy open above me. Then I looked down.

                As I looked at the beautiful scenario below me, tears glittered into my deep blue eyes, tears of pure joy. I had won. As I floated I remembered all my drills again and began to control my gliding. When I landed, my comrades were upon me laughing and shouting. I could see that they were as contented as I was that I had overcome the greatest enemy of man that is fear.

                Later my instructor landed and gave me a large grin.”I knew you could do it,” he said as he slapped my back, His face beamed with astonishment and mirth. I mumbled my thanks as a smile creased my face and then we ran to the truck with a tremendous feeling of elation.

                “When do we do it again, sir?” I asked the instructor. His reply was drowned in the shouting of my comrades.

                David had avoided flying on airplanes for most of his life because he found himself terrified of crashing. “I couldn’t stop thinking about all the disasters I heard about on the news, and every time I thought about flying, I would begin sweating and my heart started pounding. I only felt better by avoiding travel altogether.”

                But as time went on, David’s fear began to prevent him from doing things he wanted to do. He missed his niece’s graduation and an important work conference, and his fear prevented him from taking his family on the vacation to the coast. “After years of avoidance, I realized this fear was holding me back, and I had to do something about it.”

                David met with a therapist, who encouraged him to examine his thoughts about flying and to question their basis in reality. After some research, David had to admit that his fears about plane crashes were greatly exaggerated in his mind—the flight industry is extraordinarily safe, and accidents are rare. The therapist also taught David some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and visualization, that he could use any time he felt afraid.

                David decided to stop avoiding his fear, and he booked tickets to take his family on their dream vacation. As the flight took off, David focused on keeping his breathing calm and even. Whenever thoughts about crashing entered his mind, he replaced them with a positive thought about how much fun he would have with his family when they arrived. He closed his eyes and imagined the warm sand and waves lapping at his feet, his children laughing and building a sand castle. As the flight progressed, David began to relax. He even enjoyed looking out the window a bit. Anytime he felt himself getting nervous, he gently turned his attention back to his breathing until the feeling passed.

                When the wheels touched the ground, he felt something more powerful than relief: “I felt so proud that I had faced my biggest fear head-on. As we landed, I felt like this thing that had such a powerful hold on me for so long had finally loosened its grip. I knew that I would probably still feel some anxiety when flying, but now I had the tools to face it with mindfulness. I finally feel free.”

                Every day he would see that many frustrated people, people with tears in their eyes and troubled by various worries were going towards Gautam Buddha and they were very happy while returning. That beggar could not understand what Gautam Buddha used to do to them so that they would become very happy? While returning there was neither a lot of money in the hands of the people nor gold and silver, then what happened that people were so happy while returning from Buddha?

                Thinking all this, the beggar also decided that he too will go to Mahatma Buddha and see what is happening there that unhappy people go to him and become happy?

                He walked to meet Buddha. Where Buddha was present, there was a very long queue, so that beggar also got in the queue. He started waiting in the queue for his turn. His turn came and he reached near Buddha.

                He said to Buddha, “Buddha I am very poor. I have nothing. I have to beg others even to run my life. Now you tell me that how can I live my life and how can I do it better? “

                On hearing all this the Buddha said, “You are not poor. You think so because till date you have never done anything for anyone. Neither have you ever donated anything to anyone. Nor have you done anything for others.”

                Hearing all this, the beggar was in dilemma. To allay his confusion, the beggar asked, “I am a beggar. How can I donate to people and help people? I have to ask others to run my own life.”

                After hearing all this, Gautam Buddha kept quiet for a while and then said to him, “You have a hand with which you can serve people and do good to others. Also you have mouth so that you say good things and encourage others. You can help others by doing all this. It is not necessary that donations be made only with money. We can also donate education if we want. If the God has given someone a perfectly good body, then he is not poor. He is simply poor in mind. He should move away from this thought and serve others. “

                After listening to all these things of Buddha, that beggar became very happy and his mind was satisfied now.

                Moral of the story – We all waste time worrying that we are poor but this is not true. The truth is that as long as our body is completely better, we can use it to move forward and improve our life. If a person just pays attention to his poverty and does not try to change it then he is a fool.

                Apart from this, we also learn from this story that donations, not only money, education, food, good thoughts, etc. should also be made. If you do not have money, you can education others or you can also share good thoughts to others. This makes society better.

One day while he was sitting in his garden, an injured swan fell near his leg. There was an arrow in his body. On seeing the swan, it seemed that some hunter has hunted him.

                Seeing the swan in trouble and seeing it fluttering, Siddhartha’s heart melted and he wanted to help the swan.

                He first took that arrow from the body of that swan and bandaged it with ointment on the injured place. After doing all this, Devdutt came to Siddharth looking for something.

                As soon as Devdutt approached Siddhartha, he said, “Well, it is with you. Bring it to me. I have hunted it. I had to work very hard to hunt it and I have the right to it.”

                On hearing this, Siddharth said to Devadatta, “No, this swan was injured and came to me. I helped it and saved his life. That’s why I have the right over it.”

                As soon as Devdutt’s point was completed, the king pacified both and then asked him what was the whole matter?

                In such a situation, Siddhartha told the king the whole thing and said to him, “Father the thing is that this swan was hunted by Devdutt but this swan got injured and came near my feet. Seeing it injured, I treated it and fixed it. Now tell me that the highest authority on this goose is mine. “

                The king considered this matter well. After considering it, he said one of the biggest things in the meeting and that was, “the right to save more than the one who is killed is the highest. Therefore, the biggest authority over this swan is only and only for Siddhartha because he save that swan. He did not kill it, but treated that swan after seeing it injured and saved its life. After the king had said this, Devdutt understood the matter very well. He also knew that the protector has more rights than the one who killed.

That is why we too should help others and help the troubled people. By doing this we make the society around us better. A good society is the hallmark of a good country. That’s why you also pledge from today that you too will definitely help others.

This time, however, the disciple noticed that the water was crystal clean. The mud had settled down and the water was fit to drink. So he collected some water in a pot and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the pot of water and smiled.

                He said, “See what you did to make the water clean? You did nothing. You just let it be. The mud settled on its own and you got pure water. Your mind is exactly like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it some time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put any effort to calm your mind. It will happen. It’s effortless.”

                Buddha’s message is crystal clear. Achieving inner peace is effortless. It is not something to struggle for. It is an effortless process which will happen on its own. The practice of mindfulness is central to Buddhist philosophy where one observes the thoughts without passing any judgment or reacting to them. There are several mindfulness meditation techniques that can help us in achieving a calm and peaceful state of mind.

    The Boy and The Nails
                A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''


    story2=  '''
    Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                No scolding, no timeouts
                It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                Playing soccer with your head
                Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                Why don’t you hit me?
                Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

    Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

    story5= '''
    Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                Moral of the story:

                Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

    A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''

    One night a snake... while it was looking for food, entered a carpenter’s workshop.
                The carpenter, who was a rather untidy man, had left several of his tools lying on the floor.

                One of them was a saw. As it went around inside the shop, the snake climbed over the saw, which gave it a little cut.

                At once, thinking that the saw was attacking it, the snake turned around and bit it so hard that its mouth started to bleed, enraging the snake even more. The snake continued to attack the saw over and over again until the saw was covered with the snake’s blood. Sadly, the snake did not realize what was actually happening.

                Dying from its own wounds, the snake decided to wrap itself around the saw and began to squeeze with all its strength but alas! it ended up killing itself.

                Sometimes during certain life situations, we react with anger not realizing that we are only hurting ourselves. In life it's better to sometimes ignore situations, people and their behavior. People say and do things but it's our decision whether to react in a positive or in a negative way.

                The carpenter and his tools in this story are like those unpolished, insensitive people and their equally insensitive utterances that cut us in the heart, hurt our sentiments, and cause us emotional damage. But it is up to us to either ignore them and go our way without letting their words touch/harm us or to react foolishly like the snake in this story and end up in a miserable condition due to our short-temper.

                “Soft answers remove anger, Rough words raise rage.”
                I would also say to all foster mom or aunts to understand that they are hurting themselves in a long run'''

    The school bus would arrive at any moment. Parth hurried to a table to drink his milk. Just then Bhakti, Parth's younger sister arrived there. She took a plate for her breakfast. Her hand mistakenly touched the glass of milk and the milk spilled over Parth's uniform.
                The ripple effects of anger
                "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.
                He was praying all the way that his class teacher should be in a good mood and pardon his coming late. But no prayers of pardons seemed to work for D.K sir. Parth's punishment was to go out on the ground and run one mile. He felt very embarrassed. All the way while running, Parth was burning inside. He blamed Bhakti for his punishment and was waiting to return home and scold her.
                He was very tired and exhausted because of his anger. When he returned home, he saw that Bhakti was studying for her geography test. "Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu", Bhakti was memorizing the capitals of Indian states. Parth entered the room and heard Bhakti's voice.
                "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                The ripple effects of anger2
                His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

                Edison became emotional reading it and then he wrote in his diary, “Thomas Alva Edison was a mentally ill child whose mother turned him into the genius of the century.”

                My mother's most generous gift is giving all her time and self to my family.
                Some background, my parents are immigrants from South Korea. They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.


                That is how generous my mother is. She gives all she has to us, and more.

                An 80 year old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45 year’s old highly educated son.
                Suddenly a crow perched on their window.
                The Father asked his Son, “What is this?”
                The Son replied “It is a crow”.
                After a few minutes, the Father asked his Son the 2nd time, “What is this?”
                The Son said “Father, I have just now told you “It’s a crow”.
                After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son the 3rd time,
                What is this?”
                At this time some expression of irritation was felt in the Son’s tone when he said to his Father with a rebuff. “It’s a crow, a crow, a crow”.
                A little after, the Father again asked his Son the 4th time, “What is this?
                This time the Son shouted at his Father, “Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times ‘IT IS A CROW’.
                Are you not able to understand this?”
                A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:-
                “Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. 
                I did not at all feel irritated I rather felt affection for my innocent child”. 
                While the little child asked him 23 times “What is this”, the Father had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the Son felt irritated and annoyed.
                From today say this aloud, “I want to see my parents happy forever. They have cared for me ever since I was a little child.
                They have always showered their selfless love on me.
                They crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today”.

                A student asks a teacher, “Why often people marry a different person then they fell in love with?”  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the wheat field and choose the best wheat and come back.  But the rule is that you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the field, went through the first row, he saw one big wheat which he instantly liked, but he wonders that maybe there is a bigger one further.  Then he saw another bigger one, but again he thought that maybe there is an even bigger one waiting for him.
                Later, when he finished more than half of the wheat field, he started to realize that the wheat is not as big as the ones he let go off, he started to realize that he had missed the best one in the search of a bigger.  So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.  This is the mistake often made by people who fell in love and lost the best person they could have in their life”.
                So, the student said, “Does that mean, one should never fall in love?”  The Teacher replied, “No Dear,  Anyone can fall in love if they find a suitable person.  But, once you truly fall in love, you must never let go of that person due to your anger, ego or comparisons with others”.
                “How do they end up marrying someone other than they loved?” the student asked.  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the corn field and choose the biggest corn and come back. But the rule is same as before, you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the corn field, this time he was careful to not to repeat the previous mistake.  When he reached to the middle of the field, he picked one medium corn that he felt satisfied with and went back to the teacher.  He described how he made a choice.  The teacher told him, “This time you didn’t came empty handed.  You looked for one that is just nice, and you had put your faith that this is the best one you can get.  This is how one makes a choice for marriage.”
                The student stood confused.  The teacher asked, “What is bothering you now?”  The student replied, “I am wondering which would have been better, marrying a person you love or loving the person you marry”.  The teacher replied, “It’s a very easy answer, only if you are willing to admit it to yourself”.

                Two inseparable friends, Sam and Jason, met with an accident on their way to Boston City. The following morning, Jason woke up blind and Sam was still unconscious. Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me. "Dr Berkeley was moved at Sam's deed. All that he could say was, "You are a very brave man Sam and God will make it up to you in one way or another". While he was moving on to the next patient, Sam called back at him almost pleading, "promise me you won't tell Jason anything".
                "You know I won't do that. Trust me." and walked away.
                "Thank you " whispered Sam. He smiled and looked up in prayer " I hope I live up to your ideas...please give me the strength to be able to go through this..Amen"
                Months later when Jason had recuperated considerably, he stopped hanging around with Sam. He felt discouraged and embarrassed to spend time with a disabled person like Sam.
                Sam was lonely and disheartened ,since he didn't have any body else other than Jason to count on. Things went from bad to worse. And one day Sam died in despair. When Jason was called on his burial, he found a letter waiting for him. Dr Berkeley gave it to him with an expressionless face and said" This is for you Jason. Sam had asked me to give it to you when he was gone". 
                In the letter he had said: " Dear Jason, I have kept my promise in the end to lend you my eyes if anything had happened to them. Now there is nothing more that I can ask from God, than the fact,that will see the world through my eyes. You will always be my best friend........Sam".
                When he had finished reading Dr. Berkeley said " I had promised Sam to keep his sacrifice he made a secret from you. But now I wish I didn't stick it Because I don't think It was worthy it".

                It was a crisp morning on June 15th,2005 when I got a call from my father, “Its a girl” he said. My joy knew no bounds and I danced around my balcony announcing the news of the new arrival to my neighbors.         
                My elder sister, Smitha(26yrs), delivered a girl on June 15th,2005. It was such a blessing for all of us. She stayed with us through her pregnancy and it was a wonderful bonding time for us. I would take care of her sleep, food, etc and be extra cautious to her. I even decorated my room with posters showcasing ‘cute’ babies.
                I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                “Do you want me to be honest?” I asked, wiping her tears, holding her hands. she nodded and moved her head but she wants to listen.
                “Well..” She began, putting her arms around me in a warm embrace. 
                “You are innocent. You are beautiful; unused. I think he liked that. All of the other girls he’d met had been screwed over already. But you were pure. Too pure for his dirty hands.”
                Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                She will teach me to do the right things,

                She will guide me through the right path,

                She will motivate me during my bad times,

                She will pray for me and for my future,

                She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

                My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter. I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter’s giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through...I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter's giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through her child’s merry eyes.
                We talked about the carefree laughter of childhood before we had bills to pay and so many responsibilities.
                I asked my daughter, "So what makes you laugh when you get older, and the children are grown, and you no longer have to leave cookies out for Santa?"
                "I don’t know, Mom, she said. That’s what I’m expecting you to show me."
                That’s the thing about children; when you think they are grown and you’ve set good examples for them, they remind you that they’re still watching.
                Our children grew up in a pastor's home with many different kinds of people coming and going in their lives in many different places. Teaching our children to have a sense of humor was just as important as teaching them to have a strong prayer life.
                One of my many favorite memories of laughing together as a pastor's family was when a precious older member of our church, who was almost blind with cataracts, would prepare meals and bring them to us. She didn't realize that she mixed all the food on one big serving plate.
                The fried fish was often on top of cottage cheese and pineapple with beans and slaw on top of that. The children wouldn't eat the food and didn't know what to say when she asked them at church how their dinner was.
                A pastor friend suggested we name our garbage can "Spot." So when the sweet lady asked the kids how the food was, they would say, "It hit the spot!" Laughter always made our lives fun and helped us get through stressful times.
                We need laughter in the good times and the bad. Laughter makes us feel good, releases pressure in a bad situation, gives us energy, and makes the most miserable situation bearable at times. In general, it gives us a sense of well-being and a sense of community.
                Doctor Madan Kataria, author of the book, Laughter Yoga, said, "Children can laugh up to 400 times a day, but for adults, this frequency drops to barely 15 times a day."
                It may even be less this year with all the stress our country and families have been through.
                In 1995 Dr. Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai, India, experimented with humor’s therapeutic benefits by approaching strangers in a park in Mumbai. He then invented a series of breathing and relaxation exercises that stimulate merriment for better health called Laughter Yoga.
                Since then, thousands of social laughter clubs have been launched in 65 countries, including the United States.
                Some physicians prescribe laughter classes to the sick, elderly, young, and healthy for its stress-reducing effects. It is proven that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter.
                The physical benefits of laughter include reducing stress hormones, strengthening our immune system, cardiac conditioning, lower blood pressure, {especially in women), and it cleanses the lungs, which can aid in respiratory problems.
                Good reason to add laughter to our lives daily, right?
                When I added up the amount of laughter in my life, I found that most of the people I spend time with are people who like to laugh.
                As inspiration, I look no further than my own friends and family. My neighbor and friend is one particular person who inspires me. She is engaged, curious, strong, beautiful, and fun at age 89 ? exactly the kind of woman I'd love to be when I'm her age, should I have the good fortune to live that long in fine health.
                Listening to her share funny stories of stressful times in her life growing up during the great depression reminds me that there is a funny side to every situation. Spending any time with her reinforces the idea that we need a sense of humor to make it through the tough times in life and gives me new energy and hope for the future.
                My sisters, who were all more than ten years older than me, inspired me the same way. They knew how to use laughter as a healing agent. When we got together, we talk about our life as children. There were sad and painful times for us, but we always managed to turn our shared stories and thoughts into laugher that brought tears to our eyes.
                During the Covid-19 quarantine, I had an amazing friend who sent me videos of funny things and attitudes to cope with the quarantine. She says we need more comedy in our lives, and she is right. The videos were respectfully humorous, and they helped me laugh at myself.
                Laughter doesn’t mean you can’t be serious or that you are insensitive to the bad things happening in the world around us.
                However, it can be the difference between a life of black-and-white and a life filled with color. Laughter may not add years to your life, but it will add life to your years! It’s like a flower that blooms when it stretches towards the sun.
                A wise person realizes eating right and exercise is the best way to stay healthy, and it is a wise person who learns the importance of laughter in their lives.
                If we need a prescription for laughter, it can be found in a book that has been around a long, long time. A Bible verse in Proverbs reminds us that joy is an important part of a healthy life. "A merry heart is good like a medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength." (17:22, NLT)
                Laughing with our grandchildren is the most fun, and we do it a lot. Sometimes when our grandchildren get into trouble, we laugh and remind our children they did the same things when they were that age. But, for some reason, they don't always think that's funny.
                However, being a role model for our adult children has meant demonstrating how to live well and happy in good times and bad. Teaching them always to have a sense of humor and a strong prayer life will be their guide to setting the same example for their children."""

                Many frogs lived in the Champakan pond. Kanduk was a jovial frog. He loved to make other frogs laugh. One day, while Kanduk was entertaining his friends in the pond, King Sher Singh came there to have a bath. Unfortunately, the king stepped on one of Kanduk’s legs and it broke. Kanduk screamed in pain. The king immediately admitted him to the hospital for treatment.
                The Minister of Laughs
                Doctor Bhola, the bear had to replace Kanduk’s leg with a wooden leg. Kanduk practised using his artificial leg and soon got used to it. Now wherever he went, he would praise his wooden leg a lot. Once Kanduk’s friend Champa, the squirrel was unwell. She was down with typhoid and was admitted to the hospital. When Kanduk heard about it, he went to visit her along with his brother Tandul.
                The hospital was crowded with patients and visitors. Kanduk decided to entertain all the patients and began narrating the story about his wooden leg. He said, “Having a wooden leg has its benefits. It cannot get injured and so does not pain!”  Then he called a patient and gave him a stick. “Hit and see.” That patient, Uluk hit Kanduk’s leg with all his might. Kanduk started laughing. He said, “See, I didn’t get hurt.” Everybody smiled looking at Kanduk. After visiting Champa, Kanduk and Tandul returned home. Kanduk began stroking his leg. Seeing this, Tandul asked, “What happened?”  “Uluk hit me on my real leg by mistake. If I wouldn’t have laughed, how would I have brought smiles on so many faces? It was a small price to pay to make others laugh.” said Kanduk and laughed out loud. Tandul was amazed and said “You are great! Kanduk. You can laugh despite the pain. Laughter is the best Medicine.”

                story3="""Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as “terminally ill”. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500.
                He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, “If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?”
                He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find – Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something funny.
                His pain was so great he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
                He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy, healthy and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
                Some people think laughter is a waste of time. It is a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to indulge in only every so often.
                Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we’re not well, laughter helps us get well; if we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
                Since Cousins’ ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind and the emotions.
                So, if you like laughter, consider it sound medical advice to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don’t like laughter, then take your medicine – laugh anyway.
                Use whatever makes you laugh – movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, New Yorker cartoons, jokes, friends.
                Give yourself permission to laugh – long and loud and out loud – whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you’re strange, but sooner or later they’ll join in even if they don’t know what you’re laughing about.
                Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure. . . laughter.

                “Oh. Hello.” She tried to sound normal. She didn’t feel normal. She felt like she was teetering on the edge of something. That feeling where you’re not sure if it’s laughter or tears — both hysterical — that will come out of your body.
                “I’m lichen it.” His voice was deep, laconic. Australian.
                “What?” Her brow furrowed. The green mask hid her mouth.
                “I’m lichen it.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. The weird feeling was still there. Tears? Laughter? She wasn’t sure, but when it came, she knew she’d have no control. None.
                You see, she’d been locked inside her two-roomed ‘palace’ for 21 days. The whole weird world lockdown had triggered her already fragile self into going into herself, into self-isolation. For longer than 14 days because…well…you never can tell. I mean, perhaps she had touched a metal hand-rail when she took the train, or when she’d walked into the toilets at the cinema. There were germs everywhere. And now they had a name.
                “Barry.” She looked at him, fully into his face, her mouth a little slack with surprise. Her eyes, wide.
                “What?” She wondered if he some kind of telepathy.
                “My name. Barry. And I’m lichen it!” He grinned at her. The lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. And his eyes twinkled. The smile was cheeky. He had no mask. Brave. His brown hair flopped onto his forehead. He had a black t-shirt on, AC/DC on the front.
                She must have looked a little puzzled. Although he could only see her eyes, they must have shown her confusion. He started to laugh. It was a deep laugh. Straight from his belly. It was lovely!
                “The bench! We’re sitting on…” he gesticulated. His hands were broad and capable. Clean too. Fingernails, neat. Blonde hairs on the backs of his hand glistened in the sun.
                It was then she noticed. She who notices everything. Every hair follicle. Every leaf on every tree. Every blade of grass. Every freckle dusting Barry’s arm.
                The bench was covered in lichen!
                She felt it. Not the lichen but the laughter. Bubbling up, like a soda bottle, shaken not stirred. It bubbled up and up and out of her! Such laughter, a beautiful sound! A beautiful feeling! The lichen!
                “I’m lichen it!” he grinned at her again, obviously glad she had reacted.
                She pulled at the mask hiding her mouth, gulping the air as the laughter came, flowing like a stream.
                How could she be laughing? With a stranger? On a park bench? At this time in the world’s history?
                But it wouldn’t be stopped. It flowed! Her every nerve, cell, neuron, given life by laughter, glowed in the sunlight. She put the mask down next to her.
                “So, you’re a lichen expert then,” she chortled, leaning over with the laughter pouring out of her. He began to laugh too.
                “I know what I’m lichen,” he replied, “And I’m lichen you!” His whole face contorted as his laughter burst out of him! He slapped his thigh, leaning backward and forwards as the hilarity took control of him.
                She tried to reply, feeling the peeling lichen under her hands. Laughter had taken control of her. All her fears disappeared in wave after wave of glorious giggles.
                She stood up, held her hand out to him.
                “Come on, Barry! I’m lichen you too! Let’s make like a tree and leave!” She let out a huge gust of laughter. Barry grabbed her hand and stood up, laughing his wonderful belly laugh.
                They wandered off. Who knows where? Nothing was open so perhaps they went back to her place. She left the mask behind.

                story11="""he doorbell rang in the late afternoon. A bearded man, dressed in a dark blazer and pants, handed Mom a large garbage bag. “Your mister ordered these,” he said, then turned and left.
                Mom dragged the sack into the kitchen of our home in suburban Sherwood Park, Alta. My 10-year-old brother came into the room: “What’s in there? It’s moving.”
                I gave a piercing, seven-year-old-girl shriek. Something in the lumpy bag was struggling to escape. Mom spun around. “Oh, shi—shoot. Take it to the garage.”
                My brother hauled the bag away. In the garage, Mom grabbed the axe from its spot on the wall. Dark-jacketed men, mysterious packages and now axes, I thought. It was turning out to be an interesting day.
                Mom approached the bag like a bomb-squad member, opened the top and retreated a few feet. There was a rustle and then a chicken with a partially detached head blasted out. Dad was a thrifty man, unable to resist the Hutterite’s price for unplucked, freshly killed (or, in this case, mostly killed) poultry.
                The chicken, delighted to be free of the cramped bag and its deceased kin, made several leaps around our garage, like a spasmodic ballerina. Mom’s former-farm-girl know-how abandoned her, and she looked a little sick. She handed my brother (whose closest experience with a live chicken was an undercooked nugget) the axe. “Chop its head off,” she said.
                “Okay.” He took a half step forward, turned pale, then handed the axe back. “You chop it off.”
                The hen ran in enthusiastic circles, letting out garbled squawks, more bothered by captivity than its neck problem. It darted toward us, wings flapping, feathers shedding. We all screamed and tried to hide behind one another. The bird darted away, terrified. Mom admitted defeat, herded us inside and called my father. Until he arrived, she eyed the door as though the chicken might grab the axe itself and hack its way through.
                Hours later, I snuck out to the garage. No more chicken, and the axe was back on the wall. When I asked Dad what happened to the animal, he told me it had run away.
                For months I watched in vain for a droopy-headed chicken lurking in the neighbourhood. To my dad’s credit, no more dark-suited men carrying bags ever arrived at our door again. And, many years later, my brother, still horrified, exclaims, “Mom handed me the axe.”

                A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''


                story_raudra2=  '''Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                No scolding, no timeouts
                It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                Playing soccer with your head
                Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                Why don’t you hit me?
                Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

                story_raudra3= '''Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

                story_raudra5= '''Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                Moral of the story:

                Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

                story_raudra6='''A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.
                Moral of the story: Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Somethings in life , you are unable to take back'''

                story_raudra9=    '''Once there used to be a child who was seen as a

                all the time. He would often get angry and not eat food

                story_raudra10= '''One night a snake... while it was looking for food, entered a carpenter’s workshop.
                The carpenter, who was a rather untidy man, had left several of his tools lying on the floor.

                One of them was a saw. As it went around inside the shop, the snake climbed over the saw, which gave it a little cut.

                At once, thinking that the saw was attacking it, the snake turned around and bit it so hard that its mouth started to bleed, enraging the snake even more. The snake continued to attack the saw over and over again until the saw was covered with the snake’s blood. Sadly, the snake did not realize what was actually happening.

                Dying from its own wounds, the snake decided to wrap itself around the saw and began to squeeze with all its strength but alas! it ended up killing itself.

                Sometimes during certain life situations, we react with anger not realizing that we are only hurting ourselves. In life it's better to sometimes ignore situations, people and their behavior. People say and do things but it's our decision whether to react in a positive or in a negative way.

                The carpenter and his tools in this story are like those unpolished, insensitive people and their equally insensitive utterances that cut us in the heart, hurt our sentiments, and cause us emotional damage. But it is up to us to either ignore them and go our way without letting their words touch/harm us or to react foolishly like the snake in this story and end up in a miserable condition due to our short-temper.

                “Soft answers remove anger, Rough words raise rage.”
                I would also say to all foster mom or aunts to understand that they are hurting themselves in a long run'''


                story_raudra11=  '''The school bus would arrive at any moment. Parth hurried to a table to drink his milk. Just then Bhakti, Parth's younger sister arrived there. She took a plate for her breakfast. Her hand mistakenly touched the glass of milk and the milk spilled over Parth's uniform.
                The ripple effects of anger
                "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.
                He was praying all the way that his class teacher should be in a good mood and pardon his coming late. But no prayers of pardons seemed to work for D.K sir. Parth's punishment was to go out on the ground and run one mile. He felt very embarrassed. All the way while running, Parth was burning inside. He blamed Bhakti for his punishment and was waiting to return home and scold her.
                He was very tired and exhausted because of his anger. When he returned home, he saw that Bhakti was studying for her geography test. "Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu", Bhakti was memorizing the capitals of Indian states. Parth entered the room and heard Bhakti's voice.
                "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                The ripple effects of anger2
                His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

                I just never knew you would turn out to be so much harmful; else, never I must have bothered to you. A friend would never do something like what you did. I indeed feel unenviable to recollect the fact that we were friends.

                I remember when I first met you. It was quite a sunny day, and our first day at college. Students of the new batch were to assemble in the main hall. It was the first time when I caught a glimpse of you. You were in your red shorts and a plain black t-shirt, with a ponytail and you looked very fine. Some boys even wanted to talk to you. I purposely stood next to you. I genuinely thought you might be a generous girl with a firm attitude. Our college principal began his speech to his New Year students and we stood straight.


                
                Suddenly a choking voice of the microphone came out of the speakers in a very harsh voice, some of the students started laughing about it, and you were one of them. You shouted and howled like a guy, and it was outrageous to see a girl doing such stuff. You suddenly turned to me and laughed, expecting that I too must laugh on this, but I just smiled at you gladly. I was very happy to get your attention, but your behavior wasn’t comforting. I desperately needed a friend in the new college, new town and most importantly a new life after school.

                We were to move back to the mess for the food. I again purposely sat next to you, hoping to have a conversation. You took my presence and began talking to me. Really, you were too amiable to me. You did not let me feel that was our first conversation, especially the way you hit me on my back repeatedly, just as if how usually boys do! I learnt you love sports, and basketball was your game. Well, it was too obvious to know, you were a tomb boy. But whatever you were, I was happy to have a good-looking sport-loving girl as my friend. We exchanged our numbers and came in contact. You lived in the college residence but I lived with my relatives in the town.


                
                Then we kept on meeting very often. Gradually, we went on being good friends. Nevertheless, you made me feel deplorable sometimes the way you dealt with others. You often cracked jokes on others, badgered and annoyed our classmates with your irritating tricks and abused girly girls for the way they dressed themselves. Sometimes, you did not spare even me with your endurable spirit of teasing. People asked me huge times to remain away from you. They all had come to know we didn’t share any single quality and that I was just being nice to you. Unfortunately, their perception was true. Many a times I felt like I should quit your friendship, but one thought always stopped me to proceed, as you were the only friend of mine, who was so popular, handsome and undeniably, my first friend in the college. But it was becoming too harder to remain friends with you.

                After a lot of patience, I decided to get separated from your friendship. I started ignoring you a bit, like if you appeared in my sight, I pretended as if I have not seen you. But I guess you caught me. You soon understood my ignorance. You came to me and directly asked me if there was anything wrong. This one single thing was only appreciating, that you were always straight in your talks. You never tangled the confusions or talked indirectly, which I definitely lacked. I then settled things by providing lame explanations. Somehow you accepted and never bothered about my ignorance as you were too much busy with your sports.


                
                Our first year came near to end. You won us the inter college basketball championship, as the captain. Principal and every one appreciated for your efforts. Really, we all were proud of you. Unluckily our exams were just one month after. You did not study the entire year and were always engaged in your basketball shots and strategies. You were horrified to see such lny syllabus and were all confused. You asked me to help you in studies. I agreed. However, I just did not know you thought me a fool. You wanted me to complete all your assignments and projects. I somehow did. You wanted me to teach you like a tutor, fill your mind with everything given in our textbooks. I agreed to explain you though, but you were not satisfied with whatever I taught you. You treated me very gratingly as if I owed a lot to you. I did every possible thing for you to get ready for exams, but still you were not gratified. You wanted more out of me; you wanted me to give more and more time to you. But I had to study for my exams too.I tried to tell you indirectly that I can’t do anything more than this, but I guess you did not want to understand my problems.


                
                I was extremely chafed by your behavior. I then decided to completely dismiss, no matter what. I began ignoring your calls and messages. I switched off my cell phone. You were annoyed by this attitude of mine and got impatient. You visited me at my place un-announced, and burst in anger. You capper clawed, yelled and abused me as if I did a crime by not giving attention to you. As soon as you left, I uttered a great cry and kept on weeping that whole night.

                We were not friends anymore. I decided never to talk to you, so did you. After that day, we often saw each other; but we turned our heads in other directions each time. Nevertheless, I’m just not hesitant to tell you, that now I actually love life without you. Moreover, I need you to know, that Friend, you are not tolerable!

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...

                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                Once upon a time there was a zombie called Patizombi, who was fed up with being the villain in everyone’s stories. So, to prove that he could do good, he decided to go hunting evil ghosts.

                But ghosts aren’t very visible and they’re sneaky too. It was only after many failed attempts that Patizombi spotted a confused ghost floating through the forest. He approached it carefully, set out his traps and jumped on him.

                The battle was going very badly until Patizombi realized that he was in fact not fighting a ghost but a clingy bedsheet he’d been trapped by.

                “Ha, ha, ha! You have fallen right into my trap, you evil zombie!” A ghost laughed, emerging from his hiding spot.

                “Ahh, evil ghost,” Patizombi replied. “I’ll catch you one day.”

                “No, no, no, no and no!” said the ghost, incredibly offended. “Excuse me, but I am a good ghost and my job is to hunt evil zombies.

                “Oh no you don’t!” objected Patizombi, “because I am a good zombie, and I am the one who hunts evil ghosts.”

                After arguing for a little while, they realised they were both telling the truth. They found it funny and became friends.

                “I suppose not all ghosts are evil…”

                “Nor all zombies…”

                “We could join forces to hunt ogres”

                And they headed as a team into the mountains, where the most fearsome ogres were hidden. Working quickly together, they found the track of an ogre that led them to a cave. As the ogre was out, they prepared a trap but while they were doing so a giant stone fell and blocked the entrance leaving them trapped.

                “Ha, ha, ha! it was so easy to trap that evil zombie and his ghostie partner!”

                “Lies!” they protested from inside, “We are not evil. The only evil one is you and we have come to catch you!”

                Once again, the discussion carried on until everyone was persuaded that none of them was evil.

                “We would never have thought that good ogres existed”

                “Neither would I have thought that a zombie and a ghost were not evil”

                It is obvious that, before you set out to hunt anyone, you need to make sure that they are evil...

                That is how they discovered that, even if a creature has a reputation for being evil, it is not always true. And this is also true for all other creatures who have a reputation for being dirty, noisy or annoying: you can never tell which ones are actually like that without first getting to know them. That is how they found many more zombies, ghosts and good ogres who joined their group of catchers of evil creatures. Everyone trusted this valley police force, which never allowed anyone to be treated badly due to prejudice and to bad reputations they did not deserve.

                There was once a fairy who was learning how to be a fairy godmother. Most magic and wonderful, she was the kindest and cleverest of all fairies. However, she was also a very ugly fairy. And no matter how much she showed her wonderful qualities, it seemed that everyone was determined to believe that the most important thing about a fairy was her beauty. In the fairy school they ignored her, and every time she flew off on a mission to help a child or anyone else in trouble, before she could say a word they were already screeching and yelling at her: "Ugly! Get out of here, weirdo!"

                Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful. But then she remembered what her mother had always told her: "My dear, you are what you are, warts and all; and never doubt that you are this way for a very special reason..."

                But then, one day, the witches of the neighbouring land invaded and destroyed the country, putting all the fairies and wizards in prison. Our fairy, just before being attacked, put a spell on her own clothes and, helped by her ugly face, she managed to pass for a witch. That way she was able to follow the witches back to their den.

                Once there she used her magic to prepare a big party for everyone, decorating the cave with bats, toads and spiders. The music was provided by a pack of howling wolves. While the party was in full swing, the fairy hurried off and set free all the fairies and wizards who had been imprisoned. When all of them were free, they worked together on one big spell which succeeded in trapping the witches inside the mountain for the next hundred years. And for the next hundred years, and more, everyone remembered the great bravery and intelligence of the ugly fairy.

                And from that day on no one in that land ever saw ugliness as a disgrace. Whenever someone ugly was born, people were filled with joy, knowing that for that new person great things lay ahead.

                Mr. Horsefly was the new head of the prairie post office. He had put a lot of time and effort into getting this highly respected position; he had even moved fields. If you asked Mr. Horsefly, he would tell you that he got the job thanks to his great deductive gifts.

                On his first day at work, he opened up shop, and into the post office came Mr. Beetle, Mrs Spider, Miss Mantis, and Mr. Grasshopper.
                Mr. Horsefly wouldn't let them so much as open their mouths.

                "Don't tell me, don't tell me. I bet I can work out what each of you came for," he said, putting a book, a plastic mat, a nail file, and some protective goggles on the counter.

                "The nail file will be for Mrs. Spider, without a doubt. With all the scratching she does, she'll need to put her nails right. “The mat”, he went on, without giving anyone time to react, "without even having to think about it, I give it to Mr. Grasshopper, since he must have to train pretty hard to keep all his hopping about up to a decent standard. The safety goggles have to be for Mr. Beetle, because having to spend all day with his face so close to the ground, he'll be needing something to protect his eyes. And finally, this big book here, has to be a Bible. I'll have to give that to Miss Praying Mantis, whom I would like to ask to include me in her supplications to The Almighty. As you will see..."

                They didn't let him finish. The comment about the mantis - well known on the prairie for having changed her name from Miss Praying Mantis to simply Miss Mantis - was just too much for everyone, and they burst out laughing...

                "Not much of a detective, are you!" said Mr. Grasshopper, between chuckles. "For a start, Mrs. Spider came for the book. She's very quiet, and doesn't scratch a soul. The mat is for Mr. Beetle, who likes to sunbathe in his swimming pool, and do it lying on his back. Miss Mantis will, of course, want the nail file. She's a bit of a flirt, you know. And the protective goggles are for me. I'm not as young as I was, and don't see to well. These days when I'm hopping on the grass I get the odd black eye..."

                “Uhu”, Mr. Horsefly interrupted, recovering a little from his embarrassment, "then you do, in fact, hop on grass!"

                "Yes, I do," answered the grasshopper, "but as you'll see, making your deductions based simply on prejudice, leads to more misses than hits..."

                How right he was! Just a few days later, after having met all the insects in person, Mr. Horsefly had a good laugh while telling this story about his deductions made from prejudice without yet having met a soul. And he understood that judging without knowing is a practice for fools.

                XT-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read "XT-27: The best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other XT-27s.

                "All robots should be like us XT-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the XT-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

                One day, he was walking along in Bionic City, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors (that's eyes to you and me, but XT-27 liked to use highly technical sounding words for everything).

                He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an XT-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were XT-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing!

                Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XT-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble (a house), on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were XT-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more.
                On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time.

                So XT-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another XT-27.
                So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push...
                When he woke up, the XT-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The XT-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The XT-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "XT-28, the best, most modern robot".
                So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The XT-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn't feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points.

                The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and... started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there.

                The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair.

To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons... It was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends.

                And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.

Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby.

Michael's father was the town´s Mayor, and Michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of Reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs.

                People liked the idea, because everyone loved Reggie. The day became known as The Day of Silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: Reggie was amazing!

Not only that, but Reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, Reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all Reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference.

                So the Day of Silence was the day Reggie´s true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head.

                This went on until, one day in the street, he met a special clown. The clown was very old and could hardly walk, but when he saw Pete in tears, he went to cheer him up. It didn’t take long to make Pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown.

                “I have no one to replace me”, said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do”. Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought “serious? A clown?”, trying to understand what the old man had told him.

                “Come, I’ll show you” said the clown.

                So the clown took Pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show Pete’s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter.

                When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at Pete and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age”.

                “It’s true,” answered Pete, smiling and returning the wink, “not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. And that’s so hard to find”. This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter.

                And that is how Pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that Pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days. While they were traveling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.

                The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha, The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.

                After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.

                Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.

                What did Buddha emphasize here? He said, It is effortless. Having 'peace of mind' is not a strenuous job; it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment, such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.

But if anyone looked closely at the painting, he could see a tiny bush growing in the cracks in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her next.

                – It is simple, – he said. — I will destroy all weapons on the Earth, and nobody will be able to fight anymore.

                – It would be great! –people exclaimed.

                The magic wand’s wave – and this was done.

                There was a peace on the planet for three days, while the majority of those who were prone to fight, sought and could not find a weapon. When they understood they’ve lost it forever, they have made spears of young trees and started to fight again.

                When the wizard heard this bad news, he said:

                – Do not worry. I will destroy all young trees, so that they will not be able to fight.

                After two or three days of useless search for young trees, suitable for making spears, rebellious people started to cut giant trees, make batons from them, and the bloodshed has started again. The Wizard destroyed all big trees. Then humans made knives and swords of metal. He destroyed all metal on the planet. People made sling and began to throw stones at each other. It was necessary to destroy the stones, too. And then peacekeepers began to worry: all trees have disappeared; there is no metal and stones. How to live, what to eat now? There will be no vegetation soon, and people will die without even fighting. No, this is a wrong solution of the problem.

                The Wizard became confused:

                – I do not know how to behave now. I would have destroyed all humanity, but, unfortunately, it is not in my power!

                The peacekeepers fell into despair; they did not know what to do. And then one clever kid turned to the Wizard.

                – I know what you should do. Let people feel, how others perceive their actions. If one person hurt someone, let him feel the same pain, and if he brings joy to someone, let him feel the same joy. So no one will hurt each other, because he will feel the pain immediately too and would have to stop.

                All people were inspired with the greatness of kid’s thought, and the wizard realized his idea. He returned all trees, stones and metals.

                Since that day nobody on the planet tried to hurt his neighbour, because he would have to feel the same pain too. People began to help each other, because they liked the sense of joy they felt at this moment. And they began to live in harmony and joy.

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...
                
                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”
                “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.
                The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,“Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If U have any question, ask the nurse!!”
                “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
                The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”

                There was a monk who lived on the edge of a small town, much to the delight of the townspeople. Whenever he ventured into town to help someone, everyone came out of their homes to give him gifts from their gardens, calling out to him, "Oh, Teacher, we're so fortunate to have you living nearby! You are such a wonderful person! You do so much good, Teacher! Your presence is such a blessing!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                One day a young woman came to the monk's hut and said, "Oh, Teacher, I'm in terrible trouble. I'm pregnant and my family will disown me. The young man who I love so much has fled to another town because my family would certainly do him harm. I have nowhere else to turn and no one else to ask for help."

                The monk replied that she could live in the back room and help around the house and she would then have the security of a home for her child.

                Well, now when the monk went into town, he was reviled. "You dirty old man! Look how you have betrayed our trust and taken advantage of that young woman! How could we have ever believed in you? What shame you have brought on us!" And they hurled rotten fruit at him along with their insults.

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                After a while, the father of the child returned to the town and presented himself before the family, saying, "I have spent the past two years learning a trade in a neighboring town and now I am able to provide a home for your daughter and grandchild." The family was overjoyed. Although it wasn't the best of situations, it was so much better than they had feared that they welcomed their daughter and grandchild back into the family with open arms.

                How different it was when the monk came into town then. The townspeople lined the road every time, presenting him with gifts of food and calling out, "Oh, Teacher, how could we have ever doubted you? Look at the wonderful thing you have done! We are so ashamed! Please forgive us! You are such a wise and compassionate person! We are so fortunate to have you living nearby!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                While there is no single interpretation that would do justice to this story, it certainly speaks to the equanimity of the monk. Against the backdrop of praise and condemnation, he holds himself apart from "what everyone thinks" even as he acts with the most compassionate and involved sense of responsibility. Whether in public or the workplace or in the privacy of home life, people will misread our intentions and jump to conclusions that cast us in a bad light. The most straight-forward lesson of this story, then, is that by continuing on the most ethical course of action our true intents become known. This, however, can be a short-lived vindication as the same thing may happen all over again: We ought not be pulled off-center by shallow praise any more than by shallow criticism.

The troubles weighed on her grief and eventually broke her spirit and she died without ever telling her son about the jewel.

Filled with sorrow at his fate, he endured the passing years with an abiding belief in the unfairness of life.

                One day, as he was chopping wood, his sleeve caught on a branch and tore open. Out spilled the priceless jewel onto the ground before him!

                The source of happiness -- real wealth -- is our birthright, something we carry with us from childhood whether we remember it or not. We are rich, the story says, even when we feel deprived. This is because, of course, the jewel represents the perfect nature of the true, original self with which we are born. Upon finding the jewel, the young man realized he had been rich all along -- and his life changed irreversibly in just that single moment of recognizing the jewel.

That beautiful white pigeon could fly high in the blue sky up from one tree to another tree, from one rooftop to another. Her wings made sounds like Phad... Phad… Phad... and she never seemed to mind because she had faith in her own capacities gifted by God… on her powerful wings!

                The pigeon lived in her nest made on Noore Allah Masjid, made with straws & threads collected from St. Mary’s Church near the Gurudwara.

                One sad day, when the pigeon flew out, it started to rain. Although she flew with all her might, she couldn’t get home again. She beat her wings against the rain, but they got wet and slowly some feathers drooped from her wings, and shewas injured due to this.

                The pigeon tried her best to fly. But she knew that she was “pooped.”

                A kind 7-year-old girl, Krishna, was watching that troubled pigeon. Krishna was enjoying a bath in the rain that time.

                Krishna saw the poor pigeon fall into her garden. Krishna felt that in that situation her duty was quite simple. She took that tiny frail bird and kept her warm and dry. She gave her water so she could drink, some food to eat and told her, “Not to cry... you will be o.k. soon Mashkalli!”

                Krishna named the pigeon “Mashkalli” because of Mashkalli’s beautiful white colour and eyes like diamonds. Krishna told Mashkalli, “You look like a “Shantidoot… Messenger of Peace & love!”

                Krishna cared for Mashkalli for fifteen days, until Mashkalli became quite strong. Krishna took Mashkalli everywhere she went, to school, to work, and to play. They grew very close during this period.

                One day Krishna watched Mashkalli fearfully. Krishna knew Mashkalli wouldn’t be there long.

                “Please, mummy, may I keep this bird Mashkalli? Now Mashkalli loves me and I love her. We are friends; I just can’t let him go.” Krishna’s voice was sad and low when she requested her mother.

                Krishna’s mother spoke softly and gently. She knew just what to say, “Look Krishna! Mashkalli’s home is somewhere else. Mashkalli’ must soon fly away... our garden has been a resting place for her, just like a small hotel or hospital. Krishna, it is nice of you that you took care of your bird friend Mashkalli. In her troubled time. However, this does not mean that you can keep her in any cage. If you really love someone, let us free them! If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly come back to you someday…!”

                Yes, what Krishna’s mother said was very true. It happened the next day. Mashkalli circled overhead, and then she flew away, as Krishna watched.

                Krishna felt a little sad for a few days because she was missing Mashkalli a lot. However, Krishna had full faith in her mother’s words. “If you really love someone you have to free them. If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly comeback to you someday…!”

                Now Mashkalli was rather home again. She was feeling very happy. Mashkalli again started to flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir.

                Now, “The Messenger of Peace & love: Shantidoot Mashkalli” takes a little longer flight. Mashkalli always stops at Krishna’s garden to tell her friend hello, pay thanks, and play with her every morning.

                If this, an uneducated bird can pay thanks to her helper, why not we, so called educated humans…?”

                In the rising sun’s light of hope, little Krishna was thinking this, and Shantidoot Mashkalli was eating food from Krishna’s little, soft palm, sitting on her hand. Krishna’s mother was watching that special friendship of an innocent human and an innocent bird. She smiled.

                REALLY LOVE SOMEONE? FREE THEM…

                A man woke up in the middle of a dirt road. Half of his face had brown dirt covering it, and his hair was a mess. His shirt was ragged, and he had lost a shoe. His vision was all blurry, and he was squinting in the sunlight, struggling to make use of his eyes. He could see a few hazy trees in the distance, beyond the expanse of dry, yellow land and grass. He had been in an accident. He had fallen from his buggy, banged his head, and had forgotten everything about himself. He had woken up with absolutely no memory of anything whatsoever. He knew he should have some memories, but he could locate none. He became very afraid. Who was he? How had he got here?

                As his vision continued to adjust to his surroundings, he saw a pile of papers on the ground, and a little red booklet resting on the top of them, just a few meters from where he was. He had not noticed, however, that a few meters to the left of this pile of information, was a lion.

                The lion walked gently in front of the papers, creating a barrier between them and the man. Then the lion sat down on his hindquarters, and looked at the man in the eyes.

                The man did not move. He was well aware that it was a lion now.

                "I saw what happened," said the lion, seeing that the man had no idea.

                "You were driving too fast in that thing," the lion nodded towards the buggy further down the dirt road, which was tipped over on its side. "And you fell out. These papers have all your information on them, your name, address – all of your details."

                The man felt like he was frozen to the warm earth beneath him.

                "Oh, and don't worry," added the lion, forgetting how things may have appeared to the man "...I'm not particularly hungry."

                "May I have the papers?" asked the man, wishing to get away with his details as quickly as possible.

                "Yes, of course," said the lion, standing up and ready to remove the blockade he had created.

                "Oh, thank you," said the man, relieved, "I don’t even remember who I am!"

                At this the lion stopped. He sat back down. This was too good to spoil. A man who had no ideas about himself? No psychological baggage at all? No identity to speak of? Oh, how wonderful...

                "Ah, amnesia of the self," said the lion, feeling refreshed. "Beautiful."

                "What do you mean beautiful?" asked the man impatiently, "I need my identity back! I mean...who am I? I know nothing of my past, not even my own name! Please!" he begged, "The papers!"

                "Listen to yourself panicking like this," the lion chuckled. "This is quite silly."

                "But I have absolutely no identity!" cried out the man, pleading for this lion to give him some information about himself.

                "I will give you these papers," said the lion, "but I want you to look at something. At the moment you know nothing about yourself, but you do not deny your own existence. You are begging me to give you your name and personal history, because without these stories you feel you are nothing, no one – that you don’t exist without your identity. But you are still here. Do not confuse your name, history and occupation with who you are. You exist, no matter what your story, what your name. If you were not so desperate for labels and definitions to create an identity for yourself, you would feel so free, so happy, so at one with this creation. Can you not just be comfortable having no definitions for a moment, and really be aware of what you truly are?

                "This is a blessing in disguise,” added the lion.

                This man felt he could not argue with the lion anymore, so he followed his orders. Who was he? This was what he was trying to find out through the information on those papers. But the lion was right, at the moment this man had no ideas about himself, yet somehow, his existence was being fully felt. His existence was present, but now it was no longer connected to any ideas. His existence was not limited to any particular form, it was everywhere, making up everything.

                The lion was now standing, looking at the man, with dark, deep eyes. As the man looked back at the lion, he felt like whatever was looking out of the lion's eyes, was not separate from what was looking out of his own.

                "Now you can have the papers." The lion pushed them with its paw towards the man, and they made a scraping noise on the ground. The man crouched down, picked them up, but now was not so eager to give himself a description. He figured these papers would be useful so he could find his house, get his bearings, but he didn’t need them to know who he was just yet. He placed them in his back pocket, and skipped off towards the hut he could now see in the distance, completely free of the ideas about himself he previously had.

                There abode in Thessaly, in the days of Hercules, a strange race of men who had the head and arms of a man together with the body of a horse. They were called Centaurs, or Bull-Slayers.

                One of them named Cheiron, famous for his knowledge of medicine, music and botany, had been the teacher of Hercules. But many of them, although learned, were not good. Hercules and Theseus had waged war on them and had killed many, so that their numbers were greatly lessened.

                Having married Deianira, the daughter of a powerful King of Calydon, in Greece, Hercules was traveling home with her when he came to the banks of a river and was at a loss how to cross it. Seeing his perplexity, Nessus, one of the Centaurs, offered to take Deianira on his back and carry her over the stream. This offer Hercules gladly accepted.

                No sooner, however, did the crafty Centaur obtain possession of Deianira than he made off with her, intending to have her as his own wife. You can easily imagine how angry this outrage made Hercules. He shot one of his poisoned arrows with so much force that it went right through the traitor Centaur, and wounded him even unto death.

                But, before dying, Nessus had time to tell Deianira that if she wanted to keep Hercules always true to her she had but to take his shirt, and, when her husband's love was waning, prevail on him to wear it.

                Deianira took the shirt, and shortly afterwards, being afraid that her husband was ceasing to love her, she sent it to him as a present.

                Now, you will remember that Hercules had shot through the shirt of Nessus one of his poisoned arrows, and you will not be surprised to hear that some of the poison had remained in the shirt. So when Hercules put it on, which he did immediately upon receiving it, he was seized with frenzy and, in his madness, he uttered terrible cries and did dreadful deeds.

                With his powerful hands he broke off huge pieces of rock, tore up pine-trees by their roots and hurled them with resounding din into the valley.

                He could not take off the fatal shirt, and as he tore off portions of it he tore, at the same time, his quivering flesh.

                The servant of Deianira who had carried him the fatal shirt, and who wished to solace him in his pain, he seized as she approached him and flung headlong into the sea, where she was changed into a rock that long, so runs the legend, kept its human form.

                But at ln the majesty and the courage of the hero asserted themselves, and, although still in agony, his madness left him.

                Calling to his side his friend Philoctetes, he wished to embrace him once more before dying; but fearful lest he should, in so doing, infect his friend with the deadly poison that was consuming him, he cried in his agony: "Alas, I am not even permitted to embrace thee!"

                Then he gathered together the trees he had uprooted and made a huge funeral pyre, such as was used by the ancients in burning their dead. Climbing to the top of the heap, he spread out the skin of the Nemean lion, and, supporting himself upon his club, gave the signal for Philoctetes to kindle the fire that was to reduce him to ashes.

                In return for this service he gave Philoctetes a quiver full of those deadly arrows that had been dipped in the blood of the Hydra of Lerna.

                He further enjoined his friend to let no man know of his departure from life, to the intent that the fear of his approach might prevent fresh monsters and new robbers from ravaging the earth.

                Thus died Hercules, and after his death he was received as a god amongst the Immortals on Mount Olympus, where he married Hebe, Jove's cupbearer. In his honor mortals were commanded to build altars and to raise temples.

                The county recreation center swimming pool where one gets such badges presents very different conditions to those created when a June storm dumped six inches of rain over Columbia in Missouri with little warning—causing floodwaters from creeks to burst their banks, causing overflow zones to turn into ponds.

                When 15-year-old Dominic Viet and 16-year-old Joseph Diener passed a basketball court that had turned essentially into a water polo area, they heard the frantic shouting of a young woman desperately trying to keep her head above water under the force of a current.

                The boys had seen the girl swimming with a friend there before, but it was now obvious she was drowning.

                “The first thing that came into my mind was to get into the water,” Dominic told CNN. “We didn’t have time to think, her head was barely above the water and we could see her sinking more down every second. We didn’t think about the risks, we had to get her out.”

                Heroes will do as heroes do, and hoisting her up onto their shoulders, Dom and Joseph got her ashore, where emergency services arriving at someone else’s call performed first aid and rushed her to the hospital.

                Floodwaters are no conditions to be swimming in. There can be sewage runoff, loose chemicals, downed power lines charging the current with electricity, or physical debris such as manhole covers that have been lifted out of their sockets by the force of the water.

                Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Jenkins described the boys’ act as heroic and brave, as did Dominic’s mom, who had been calling her son for some time before and was growing nervous.

                She sent her husband, Dom’s father, to check on his position, but when he arrived he saw ambulances and firetrucks from the call that was meant to rescue the young woman.

                “I thought of the worst, he’s on a bike and people weren’t paying attention and my fear was he was going to pull up and see our son on the ground,” said Mrs. Viet. “But then he saw them on their bikes heading back to their friend’s house, and I got a text from Dominic saying ‘Coming home soon, just saved a woman’s life Mom.'”

                Oh Mom… how about you have a little faith?

                Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant acted with bravery that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest honor.

                On Friday, Ralph Puckett, Jr. was hosted at the White House where he received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. government’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.

                Ralph’s first response was to ask, “Why all the fuss? Can’t they just mail it to me?”

                But, after his lifetime of service to the nation, President Joe Biden said at the medal ceremony, “Rather than mail it to you, I would’ve walked it to you.”

                Ralph’s wife of 68 years, Jeannie Puckett, was in the audience, too, as Biden described how the couple met—while the brave Army Ranger was recovering from his wounds.

                They were married two years to the day after the battle in November, 1950, for which he was honored this week with the following citation: “For acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the commander 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company…”

                51 of Puckett’s Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out in a daylight attack to take Hill 205, just 60 miles from the border with China, which drew mortar, machine gun, and small-arms fire against them. First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in their offensive.

                To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire.

                “Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position, with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” continued the citation.

                When the Rangers finally reached the top of the hill, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn’t nearly over.

                “During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett.”

                Even though Puckett’s Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one, five attacks by a battalion-strength enemy were repulsed.

                During the first wave, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support. Over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.

                “He repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole, to check the company’s perimeter and to distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers.”

                Extraordinary selflessness above and beyond the call
                When the enemy launched a sixth attack, two mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting “grievous wounds” in both his feet, his backside, his left arm and shoulder.

                “Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy.

                Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy-controlled hill.

                First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

                First Time a Foreign Leader Attended This Ceremony
                Biden said in his remarks, “Korea is sometimes called the “Forgotten War.” But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett’s command — they’ll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.”

                “And the people of the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the President of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before.”

                President Moon said, “I learned that I’m the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.

                “Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean War… Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea.”

                “From the ashes of the Korean War, we rose, we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea’s peace and freedom. And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.”

                Puckett’s military service did not end in the Korean War. He also served in the Vietnam War, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars, adding to his five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.

                Visionaries are often accused of being a little mad. Even by their wives. Such was the case of Laungi, a resident of India’s drought-blighted Gaya district in the eastern state of Bihar.

                Loungi Bhuiya had become increasingly distraught as more and more farmers—including four of his own sons—left Kolithwa for greener pastures. Taking a leaf from Don Quixote, Bhuiyan was determined not only to dream an impossible dream but to make that dream come true by single-handedly bringing water to his village in hopes of transforming the barren land into arable acreage.

                Inspired by the earlier exploits of “Mountain Man” Dashrath Manjh, who, with just a hammer and chisel, spent 22 years carving a road through the mountain near the village Gehlaur from 1960 to 1982, Bhuiya set out to dig an irrigation canal by hand to the closest water source in the Bangetha Hills.

                “I had heard about him and I thought if he can do it, why can’t I?” Bhuiya told Al Jazeera. “They all thought I was mad.”

                “He decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village,” Village leader Vishnupat Bhokta told the Tribune of India.

                “The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”

                Despite the teasing from his family and fellow villagers, the now 70-year-old Bhuiya toiled every day to make the four-foot-wide by three-foot-deep canal a reality. It took him nearly 30 years to accomplish his goal, but now everyone is benefitting from the fruits of his decades’ long labors.

                Bhuiya, whose reputation as a neighborhood eccentric has since been transformed into local hero, was recently rewarded for his efforts with a brand-new Mahindra tractor, which will be used to expand the canal.

                Of course, when Quixote creator Miguel de Cervantes wrote: “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical may be madness. To surrender dreams, this may be madness… Maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be,” he wasn’t referring to Bhuiya—but he just as well might have been.

                My friend and I were at the Coliseum to see the Raiders play the Tennessee Titans. After the game, as we were heading out, someone’s phone fell and smashed near us, and then a bunch of people started pointing up. There was a woman up there on the edge of the railing. I turned to Glenn and said, “Do you think she’s gonna jump?” He said, “Oh, boy, she’s falling as we speak."
                It’s about a four-story drop from where she fell, and — without thinking — I just put my arms out as she came toward me. Listen, I was in the Marines, and even though that was 40-some years ago, I still think like a Marine; fortunately, I still react like one once in a while. She leveled out flat as she hit my arms, and bounced off me and fell about four feet away. I fell to the ground, too, from the impact, and I blacked out for a minute. When I came to, Glenn was holding up fingers and saying, “How many do you see?” I was OK. The woman was alive but was in a coma for a while and had brain surgery. She later told me she was very grateful — they call her Miracle Girl. But what bothered me was that I didn’t do a better job of saving her. I couldn’t really latch on to her.

                It was 5 a.m. when I heard somebody screaming, “Help! It’s a bear!” I opened my front door, and there was a 275-pound polar bear sitting on its haunches with a woman in its mouth, waving her around like a rag doll. I thought to myself, I’ve got no weapon or anything. Then I saw my shovel sitting there and found myself going to get it. Once I picked it up, I thought, Well, am I going to do anything, or is that woman going to die? So down the steps I went. 
                When I got over there, I stepped up and hit the bear in the eye. I’d heard this is the best way to fight a bear. He let go of the woman, and she ran into my house. The bear reached out and grabbed ahold of me, and the mauling was on. He tore off my right ear, and I was waiting for him to bite me again. A neighbor fired a shotgun, but it didn’t do any good, so he jumped into his truck and gunned it toward us. I was on my belly on the ground, watching this vehicle speeding our way, and it stopped about two feet away before the bear let me go.

                I spent seven days in the hospital. They worked on me for four hours one day, to staple my wounds, and then for four hours the next day, putting my ear back on. So I came out of it pretty good.

                I never saw myself as a hero and still don’t. You’re dealt a situation, and you either respond or you don’t do anything. People say, “Would you have done anything differently?” I haven’t the faintest idea. The only thing I could think was, If I don’t do anything, she’s not going to make it.

                The crash woke me up. Just after midnight, on a very windy Sunday last October, I heard a very loud noise, and it was a large fir tree falling into my yard from the neighbor’s yard. It crushed a greenhouse and took down the tip of a power line as it landed. I’ve been in my house almost 50 years and know how much damage wind and trees can do, but as I was coming downstairs and glanced outside, I was horrified to see brilliant flames outside my window, way up over my head.

                I live alone­ — my husband died six years ago — and I thought, I have to call 911. But there was no time. I thought, This could go everywhere. It could burn the whole hill. I threw on something over my nightgown, raced outside, grabbed a hose and started spraying water as hard as I could. The wind had already spread the flames to a live oak and then to some blackberry vines on the edge of my driveway. It was really howling now, and I could feel the heat, but I just braced myself and kept on squirting.

                This must have gone on for five minutes, but it felt like an hour. An architect neighbor smelled smoke and ran over to help. Then the couple across the driveway came, and someone called the fire department. When the fire trucks arrived, they yelled at us to move back, but I couldn’t stop. I said, “We have to keep water on this fire.”

                I had no idea I had done anything special. People I never met were knocking on my front door the next day, saying, “You’re a hero. You saved the hill.” But I was just the first responder. I saw what I saw, and I took action.

                Thousands of people lost everything that night in other parts of California. We were fortunate to be spared. But I don’t think it was a miracle. The reality is, my children weren’t there and my husband wasn’t there, and if I wanted to stay in the home I loved, I would have to step up. So I did — but then got a lot of help.

                Once upon a time 10 years ago I had my 15th birthday. My mum woke me up this marvelous morning and told me I had a special delivery at the front door. I dressed myself and ran down the stairs in excitement. When I opened the front door to my surprise I found a big box in the middle of the door way. I jumped in joy and ran inside to see my aunties, uncles, brothers, cousins, grandparents and the rest of my family that were already awake.Everyone wanted me to open the box already but I waited till I put it on the table. Oh my goodness I was about to open it when I heard a noise coming from the box. IT WAS A KITTEN AND A PUPPY. I quickly opened it and found an adorable kitten who was all black with ginger and white patches on her. I named her Precious. Aw how cute was she. After that I carefully took my puppy out of the box and held him. He was a little tiny black and white dog with a few patches on him. I chose to name him terror because he tore the box open before I got him out. My family told me that I got my puppy Terror from my male relatives and I got the kitten Precious from my female relatives. The afternoon was here already and I had turned 15 at 12:13PM. My friends came over to celebrate my birthday. When they all got here to my surprise I had found a huge gift from all of them. I opened this card up and found airfares to Sydney and to go to Palm Beach to meet my inspirations, the cast of home and away. " OH MY GOODNESS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY EVER I CAN'T BELIEVE IT" We all went out and had an amazing time. That isn't all you get Jessica. " We are all going out tomorrow before you leave to Sydney with all of your family. "WHAT YOU MEAN I AM LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT WITH MY FAMILY TO GO ON AN AEROPLANE"? "YEP YOU GOT IT RIGHT GIRL". "SEE THIS IS LEGIT THE BEST DAY EVER"I exclaimed. "WE HAVE ALSO GOT YOU TICKETS TO MEET AND GREET ONE DIRECTION AND YOU WILL BE STAYING IN THE SAME HOTEL AS THEM". "WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "I LOVE YOU GIRLS SO MUCH YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME". "Well girly you and your family better start packing because you leave tomorrow night and we are all going out tomorrow to celebrate your 15th". "Alright"! Guess what Jessica. "What"? "That isn't it we haven't told you another surprise. "WHAT IS IT"? "WE ARE COMING TO Sydney ASWELL AS YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF. SO IS TERROR AND PRECIOUS"? "AHHHHHHHH ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "YEP WHY WOULDN'T WE BE"? "WHERE IS PRECIOUS AND TERROR GOING TO STAY"? "WITH YOU". "TERROR AND PRECIOUS ARE STAYING WITH YOU AND WE FLY OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON JETSTAR JQ1314 AT 9:00PM."WHEN WE GET TO SYDNEY EVERYONE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT AND EVERYTHING". The day came and I was super excited. at about 10:30PM we arrived at Sydney airport and it felt so good to be in my favorite place. I mean this was the best birthday ever that I will never ever ever ever forget in a whole life time. Jetstar was an amazing flight and we had the best time ever.

                Life is full of unexpected surprises. There are many opportunities when one can secretly wish for something exciting to happen – something out of the ordinary. The real surprise is when the wish unexpectedly comes true. I never believed that something like this could ever happen to me; such a thing that would make me stop and look back at the events in awe. I think you would agree that something as simple as being lost in the forest for less than ten minutes should have no influence on my life. If you do agree, that makes both of us wrong.

                Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Coote’s Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

                As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. That’s when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that can’t be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

                I think that another reason that I felt carefree was because my parents didn’t panic. They took the situation under control and headed for any open area in hopes to find a map (many of these maps were found throughout the grounds, telling you where you were). From my point of view, at the time, it seemed as if they were excited as I was about losing our way. In the end, it only took my parents ten minutes to find such a map and we were back on the trail in no time.

                An experience like this made me think about my place in life. I’m the type who loves seeking out adventures. When we were lost, I realized that I had everything I would ever need with me – my family. They’ve always supported me in everything I do. This experience made me realize that families need to stick together; you don’t realize how much you need them until, for a moment, you think they’ll be the last people you see for the rest of your life.

                It’s incredible how much a simple thing like being lost in a forest for ten minutes will affect your outlook on life. Things like not being able to find your way back to where you came from make you appreciate the little things in life. Looking back on the day, I realize now that it was fate. Moments like that are few and far between and should be taken as a lesson. Surprises like this were, and always will be, an unexpected gift for all.

My Mom told that our neighbour, Shanti Bhabhi had given birth to a little fairy, the lakshmi of the home, a baby girl. But suddenly this happiness curve on my face disappeared with the thought of her husband. Shanti's husband, Raju bhaiya who was not a good man. A drunkard by nature, he had never provided that space to his wife and his male chauvinism was fiercely aggressive. I once heard his words in the street to the little daughter of our neighbours that studying and playing doesn't suit girls. They are meant for bangles and making rotis, just like a common male chauvinist. The prevailing awareness of the maltreatment of girls in the media, shook me again. I just wished that this liitle fairy should not face such a treatment and should be brought up on an equality basis with the sons of the same house. But somewhere in the heart the thought took place so firmly that I went to Shanti Bhabhi's house and what I saw next was unbelievable. I saw Raju Bhaiya with his little daughter in his hands and saying that he wished to grew his daughter with all the best education that he can afford. The love and incredibility of the moment rolled down tears from my eyes. I got back to my home relaxing that really the little fairy has brought happiness and a positive change along with a pleasant surprise.

                After a long bout with Parkinson’s, my Grandmother had passed. And as a pleasant surprise, I was in the will. I had inherited her car, and the ghost that came in the car. That’s right. Grandma’s car was haunted. Her 1980 Chevy Citation was haunted.

                I was surprised in so many ways. Hell, when I first turned the key I didn’t think that the thing would even start, let alone be haunted. It was an aged hunk of junk, and hadn’t seen much use in the past twenty years. And then when I saw the little figure creeping along the dash, I started to wonder if this was why she chose to stop driving it; and not because of the glaucoma.

                I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find something that wasn’t static, when it came. It was tiny, the size of my hand. It was the classic ghost. Literally, the classic ghost. In a little white sheet (a handkerchief, really) with tiny holes where the eyes and mouth would be. I couldn’t see any feet beneath the hem of the shroud, but it seemed to have tiny little hands poking up as it levitated towards me. And as it came drifting along, it was making a little ethereal ‘whooooooo’ sound at me.

                It was freaking adorable.

                I mean, come on. It was like a kindergarten Halloween decoration had come to life and came to visit. It was so little! It was smaller than the rat I had when I was in college. It was smaller than my breakfast sandwich. I wanted to pet it.

                I suppose in retrospect, yeah. I should have been a little more respectful. Maybe taken it a little bit more seriously. Seeing visible proof of the afterlife, actual confirmation of existence after death… well, that’s serious stuff. And, one would think, deserved more respect than the delirious giggles I wasn’t holding back.

                I think even the little ghost was actually taken aback by this. It stopped mid-‘whoo’ and kind of stared at me. It just drifted in place, bobbing like a floater in the corner of your eye.

                And there I sat, snickering and crouched back against the driver’s side door of the old Citation. The car still smelled like Vicks and old menthol cigarettes, the defining scents of my dear old Grandma.

                Was this Grandpa, maybe? Could it be? My mind raced. Grandma never spoke much of her ex-husband, just that he was a son of a bitch and that he had gotten his ‘just desserts’. Did his ‘just desserts’ involve being murdered and cursed to haunt a handkerchief on his jilted wife’s dashboard? But then I remembered mom saying that her dad had just jumped ship and moved to Iowa, where he had died in 1979.

                So my theory was obviously sunk. I peered at the little thing, static from the dusty old radio an idle buzz in the back of my mind. The ghost just bobbed in the warm air beneath the windshield, occasionally emitting little ‘Whooo’s!’ at me. I didn’t think it was trying to scare me anymore.

                Then a much more troubling idea occurred to me. What if this thing was my grandmother? Oh, now that’s a terrible thought. I couldn’t think of a worse fate than being doomed to spend the rest of eternity haunting the interior of a mid-80’s compact.

                And worse, if this was my Grandma’s spirit then I’d feel especially guilty taking the Citation to the junkyard to sell for parts.

                I had to know. I sat in thought for a moment, then came to a resolution. I was going to see exactly who — or what — this thing really was. I sat up in the drivers seat, steeled myself. I reached out towards the little ghost with my fingers trembling.

                I won’t lie to you, I was terrified. At first I thought the whole thing was kind of funny, this little cutesy ghost the size of half a donut. But the prospect of what could be under that little white sheet, that scared the hell out of me. I didn’t want to see my undead Grandma, pale and shrunken and horribly shriveled after death. I wanted Grandma to be in heaven with Great-Uncle Al, and all of her dogs, and her one cat that I had liked.

                As I slowly reached out my shaking hand, it actually reached out to me a little bit. I was startled, and snatched my hand back a little bit. But I focused, and mentally pushed my hand forward again. I had to know.

                I yanked up the little white sheet with my eyes shut tight, and after a second I slowly eased them open so that I could see who — what — it was.

                I didn’t know the guy.

                I ended up making four hundred bucks at the junkyard. Which was another pleasant surprise

                I had got the money by work done at home, out of office hours. It came to four pounds altogether. At first I thought I would use it to discharge a part of our debt to Eliza’s mother. But it was very possible that she would send it back again, in which case the pence spent on the postal orders would be wasted, and I am not a man that wastes pennies. Also, it was not absolutely certain that she would send it back. I sent her a long letter instead–my long letters are almost her only intellectual pleasure. As for the four pounds, I reserved two for myself, for any incidental expenses, and decided to give two to Eliza. I did not mean simply to hand them to her, but to get up something in the way of a pleasant surprise.

                I had tried something of the kind before. Eliza once asked me for six shillings for a new tea-tray that she had seen. I went and stood behind her chair, and said, “No, dear, I couldn’t think of it,” at the same time dropping the six shillings down the back of her neck. Eliza said it was a pity I couldn’t give her six shillings for a tea-tray without compelling her to go up-stairs and undress at nine o’clock in the morning. It was not a success.

                However, I had more than one idea in my head. This time I thought I would first find out if there was anything she wanted.

                So on Sunday at tea-time I said, not as if I were meaning anything in particular, “Is there anything you want, Eliza?”

                “Yes,” she said; “I want a general who’ll go to bed at half-past nine and get up at half-past five. If they’d only do that, that’s all I ask.”

                “You will pardon me, Eliza,” I said, “but you are not speaking correctly. You said that was all that you asked. What you meant—-“

                “Do you know what I meant?”

                “I flatter myself that I know precisely—-“

                “Then if you know precisely what I meant, I must have spoken accurately.”

                But as we went to church I discovered that she wanted a new jacket. Her own was trimmed rabbit, and had been good, but the fur had gone bald in places.

                * * * * *

                Next morning I wrote on a sheet of note-paper, “To buy a new jacket. With your husband’s love.” I folded the two sovereigns up in this, and dropped the packet into the pocket of Eliza’s old jacket, as it hung in the wardrobe, not telling her what I had done. My idea was that she would put on the jacket to go out shopping in the morning, and putting her hand in the pocket, get a pleasant surprise. As I was leaving for town, she asked me why I kept on smiling so mysteriously. I replied, “Perhaps you, too, will smile before the day is over.”

                On my return I found Eliza at the front door. “Come and look,” she said, cheerfully. “I have got a pleasant surprise for you.” She flung open the drawing-room door, and pointed. In the middle of the table stood a spiraea, a most handsome and graceful plant. It stood in one of the best saucers, with some coloured paper round the pot, and the general effect was very good. I at once guessed that she had bought it for me with the change from my present to her, and thought it showed very good feeling in her.

                “I hope you have not given too much for this,” I said.

                “I didn’t give any money for it.”

                “I don’t understand.”

                “Well, you must know I had a present this morning.”

                “Of course I know.”

                “Did mother tell you? Yes, she has sent me a beautiful new jacket. Then a man came round with a barrow of plants, and he said he didn’t want money if I had any clothes to spare. So I gave him my old worn-out jacket for this spiraea, and—-“
                I remembered that I had seen the man with the barrow farther down the street.

                “Excuse me for one moment, Eliza,” I said, and dashed out after him.

                * * * * *

                He was a big, red-faced man, and he made no difficulty about it at all.

                “Yes,” he said, “I bought that jacket, gov’ner, and I don’t deny it. There it is at the bottom of my bundle, and I ain’t even looked at it since. Nor I ain’t goin’ to look now. You say there was two suvreigns in the pocket. A gent like you don’t want to swindle a common man like me. If you say the two suvreigns was there, then they’re there now, and I can return yer two pound out o’ my own, in a suttunty of gettin’ ’em back out o’ the jacket pocket. Bless yer! I knows an honest man when I sees one.”

                With these words he drew the money from his own waistcoat pocket, and handed it to me. I took it with some reluctance.

                “Hadn’t you better make quite certain—-“

                “Not a bit,” says he. “If them suvreigns were there when the jacket were ‘anded to me, they is there now. I could see as you was a man to be trusted, otherwise I’d ‘ave undone the bundle and searched long afore this.”

                * * * * *

                “What have you been doing?” said Eliza, on my return.

                “Never mind. Your mother has given you a new jacket. Let me have the pleasure of giving you a new hat.” I pressed the two coins into her palm.

                She looked at them, and said, “You can’t get a hat for a halfpenny, you know, dear. What did you rush out for just now? And why did you have these two farthings gilded? You’ll be mistaking them for sovereigns, if you’re not careful. Were you trying to take me in?”

                I did not quite see what to say for the moment, and so I took her suggestion. I explained that it was a joke.

                “You don’t look much as if you were joking.”

                “But I was. I suppose I ought to know if any man does. However, Eliza, if you want a new hat, anything up to half a sovereign, you’ve only to say it.”

                She said it, thanked me, and asked me to come and help her water the spiraea.

                “Surprises are beautiful because they come without waiting.” Not so true for Nancy though. She was sure her sister was planning a surprise for her birthday. Pulling open the pink pastel curtains of her bedroom window,  she hungrily drank in the fresh morning air. Her eyes were laced with longing. A soft smile slid across her lips which were otherwise dry with sadness and coated with grief.  Nancy was turning 30 today. “Keep calm. It’s only your 30th birthday”. Humming her favourite song in her head, her lips pursed in, Nancy ran her fingers over her thin wavy short hair. No a strand of grey! Many of her friends were already showing mini zebra stripes in their heads. But, not her! Thank goodness for that.

                She quickly glanced at the mirror and looked away. She never liked looking at the mirror. It always reminded her of what she was not. “Life is just a mirror and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you.” Wally “famous” Amos. Turning her face away from the mirror like it was an enemy on the prowl, a single glossy tear flowed down her cheek. Clutching the ends of her dress, she poured them back in again. She was not going to think of the past and all that it had done to her. She held her palms up and looked at them. Shrivelled walnuts were what they looked like. Lifeless, yet useful. “Nothing worth having, comes easy.”

                All these years she had worked at different factories, clothes, metals, chemicals, shoe, scrubbed the floors at big hotels where perfumed men and women floated easily.  Ever since their parents died, her only goal was to educate Kate, her younger sister. Her emotions came running back to the present. Quickly, she wiped her dried tears and rushed some chirpy cheer on her face. She paced to the door and back.

                “A sister is a little bit of childhood that can never be lost.” Kate was her dream, her hope, her happiness. The gleam of a thousand stars shone on her face as she thought of her sister. Her precious possession. She meant everything to her. She was all she had. Kate shined liked a diamond in a heap of coal. She was an outstanding student and an obedient younger sister. And today, Nancy was sure Kate would surprise her like she did every year. Nancy’s nostrils swelled open in anticipation of the sweet aroma of the freshly baked chocolate cake that would welcome her. Her tongue was eager to lick up the soft, brown cream and her teeth were ready to bite into Kate’s inviting delicacy. She stretched her ears with her hands to hear the sound of Kate’s footsteps coming towards her. She clapped her hands and giggled at her own act of childishness.
                She waited and waited.

                It seemed like an endless wait and a tide of emotions were rushing through Nancy. Finally, she heard her younger sister approaching her room. Her eyes lit up, her steps turned into a spring and her heart grew all  bouncy. She sniffed the air to catch a whiff of the chocolate cake but it was missing. Maybe it was not chocolate flavour this time, she imagined with pride intruding her thoughts. Her sister was all grown up now. She could surprise her with something else.

                Kate walked into her room empty handed. No cake, no flowers, no package wrapped in shiny golden paper, tied with red ribbons. The excitement dissolved from Nancy’s face. Her face looked like a blank, crumpled, white page. Kate was smiling. She could win the world with the radiance of her smile. She gave her sister a tight hug. “Happy birthday” said Kate. Nancy loosened herself from the warm embrace and looked at her sister. “Thank you” she said, smiling coldly. “And here’s your gift” Kate handed her a brown envelope. Nancy’s eyebrows shot up like mountain peaks and her eyes were flooded with questions.

                “Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love is by far the truest type of love. This is your admission letter to the community college. I want you to pick up from where you left.”

                Nancy’s eyes grew moist and her trembling hands were silenced by Kate’s firm grip over them. Nancy shut her eyes tight and let her tears flow as she folded her hands in prayer. Kate’s words sparkled with happiness and shined with guilt as she said “You deserve much more my dear sister, but this is all I can give you.”

                I was waiting for my birthday and thinking about how I wished my birthday to be. I visualised and wished that I would get some big surprise as a birthday gift from the Universe and then I completely forgot about it. But just 15 days before my birthday I was diagnosed with Typhoid. On the day of my birthday I was very weak, bedridden and taking my pills and eating only boiled food. I was unable to talk over the phone so no one called me and my family thought it was not appropriate to bring me cake as I was unable to eat it. It was my birthday evening and I was at home feeling dull.

                The Universe never forgets your wish, and it did not forget mine either, so then it happened. All my friends came over to my place and gave me a big birthday surprise! They brought the cake and a gift which was a branded Jacket, which was also one of my wishes. I had an awesome time with them and felt so happy.

                The Secret is so true and the Universe brings everything you wish for.

                One day a professor entered the classroom and asked his students to prepare for a surprise test. They waited anxiously at their desks for the test to begin. The professor handed out the question paper, with the text facing down as usual.
                
                Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no questions....just a black dot in the center of the page. The professor seeing the expression on everyone's face, told them the following: "I want you to write what you see there."
                
                The students confused, got started on the inexplicable task. At the end of the class, the professor took all the answer papers and started reading each one of them aloud in front of all the students. All of them with no exceptions, described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc. etc. etc.
                
                After all had been read, the classroom silent, the professor began to explain: "I am not going to grade you on this; I just wanted to give you something to think about. No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.
                
                Our life is a gift given to us by God, with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature renewing itself everyday, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see everyday.
                
                However we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on.
                
                The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life. Enjoy each one of your blessings, each moment that life gives you. Be happy and live a life filled with LOVE,"

                Liz was just about finished wrapping up the final details for the
                surprise party she was planning for her husband. She had
                been meticulously preparing for this event, designing every aspect
                of the party from the invitations to the food, and she was very excited
                about it.
                Family members whom Guermo hadn’t seen in years were flying in from Peru in
                a few days. Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
                from various places across the country. The caterer and band were set.
                The best part for Liz: she knew Guermo did not have a clue about the party. She
                could not wait to see the look on his face when he walked into a big “Surprise!” in
                his own home.
                The party was to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about picking
                relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to their hotel, Guermo
                walked into the kitchen and said, quite certainly, “Sweetheart, I don’t want
                anything special done for my birthday.”
                “What do you mean?” Liz responded nonchalantly, though her heart began to
                pound.
                “I mean that I don’t want a surprise party.”
                “Okay,” Liz said with a shrug. “Not a problem.”
                Liz’s mind raced. There was nothing she could do about Guermo’s request now.
                And, frankly, she didn’t want to. Liz had been planning this for more than a year.
                The party would go off as she intended. She did not want all of her effort to be for
                naught.
                When Guermo came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends,
                he was shocked. Tears filled his eyes. (This response was something Liz had not
                predicted.) Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in nearly 20
                years and family members who had come from Peru just for this evening.
                But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry with his wife. He
                felt ambushed. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like people to
                see him that way. That was why he did not like being surprised.
                Salsa music filled the home of Liz and Guermo. Guests filled up on ceviche, lomo
                soltado and empanadas. Liz whispered “I love you” in Guermo’s ear, they shared
                a kiss, and the two danced the night away.

                Once upon a time a plump old woman name Tante Adela lived in French Canada.  She lived all alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

                One morning she got up very early as it baking day and there was much to do.  She took a load of wood outside to her oven. 

                “Now why would oven door be open?” she said.  She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in.  But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

                The old woman bent over to look in.  When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut. She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

                When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

                At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw the neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

                “Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick!  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Felix.  “Maybe it is your cat.”

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

                “I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

                Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road.  She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross.  After all, three heads are better than two.

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down its back?”

                “Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath.  “Come right away!  There is a skunk in my oven.”

                “A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

                “Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela.  “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

                “You have a point,” said Louis Ross.  “I will come over as soon as I have finished feeding the chickens.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out.  “You must come to my farm.  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Samuel.  “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela.  “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snark?  I don’t think so!”

                “I will come right over,” said Samuel.  “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

                So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help.  By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there.  Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

                “Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

                “I know that!” said Tante Adela.  “The question is, what to do about it?”

                “I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “She will not be able to bake bread in there for a month!” said Madame Roy, and everyone agreed.

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “And it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel.  He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

                “What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross.  “A dog will bark.  Maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

                “If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

                “What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” said someone else.  “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                So this plan was dropped.  No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers.

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                “Oh, woe is me!” wailed Tante Adela. 

                By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk.  And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come.  Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows.  Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn.  And one by one, everyone found a reason to head home.

                At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard.  The young man may be simple-minded, she thought.  Still, who else could she turn to for help?

                “Jules!” she said.  “Jules Martel.  There is a skunk in my oven.  Can you get him out without scaring him?”
                stop
                What would you do to try and get the skunk out of the oven?

                Jules nodded his head.  He walked over to the oven.  He opened the door and leaned inside.  He spoke in a low voice.  No one could tell what he was saying.  At last he stepped back.  Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway.  Everyone stepped back a few feet.  The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground.

                Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high.  And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “How did you get him to come out?” said Samuel to Jules.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “What DID you say to it?” said someone else.

                “I just told him,” said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, “that if he stayed in the oven any more, he would begin to smell like Tante Adela’s bread.  And if that happened, none of the other skunks would come near him.”

                “Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “That a low creature like a skunk cares about what others creatures like him think of him.”

                “I suppose all creatures must have some sense of self-respect,” said Alice Roy, “no matter who they are.”  Alice Roy and the others nodded in silence

                In just three days, it will be Christmas. Despite the bright and cheery decorations twinkling in the streets, wreaths on doors, and Christmas trees peeking through windows, Hector doesn't feel one drop of joy or excitement. The magic of Christmas seems to have evaporated this year. People passing one another on the street do not wish each other Happy Holidays, smile, or even make eye contact. They simply rush by with their heads down and eyes straight ahead, their minds preoccupied with their to-do lists and avoiding human interaction. 

                Hector doesn't even feel Christmas Spirit from his own family. This morning, he woke up excited to decorate the family Christmas tree with his mother as they did every year. They had barely started wrapping the lights when the phone rang. "Oh dear, it's Aunt Susan!" Hector's mother exclaimed. "Go on without me. I’ll be back." Hector finished the whole tree by himself by the time his mother was off of the phone with her sister. Later that afternoon, Hector's father cancelled their plans to play basketball together. Even Hector's older brother, Yohan, was too busy playing video games to help Hector make shortbread cookies for the family. 

                Feeling discouraged by the lack of festivity around the village and his home, Hector snuggles up with his most comfortable blanket and lets out an enormous sigh. He turns off the light and falls asleep. 

                That night Hector's Native American grandmother, Tallulah, pays him a visit in his dream. Around eight months ago, she left Hector's family to join the great white falcon in the sky. In her gentle voice, she whispers: “Hector, it's up to you to reinvent the magic of Christmas. You can change things. Search in your heart and you’ll find the solution.”

                When he wakes up, Hector cannot stop thinking about his dream. “Reinvent the magic of Christmas,” Tallulah said. He thinks about her words and jots down ideas on a sheet of paper, but crosses them out one by one. Suddenly, his face lights up.

                After lunch, Hector hangs a “do not disturb” sign on the door of his bedroom, closes the curtains, and sits down in his laboratory. This little corner of his room is equipped with a big lamp, magnifying glass, and all the materials from the chemistry set his parents got him for his birthday.

                All afternoon, Hector experiments with various combinations of Christmas ingredients. He melts candy canes and spices into little bowls, then mixes them with some of the plant oils that his grandmother Tallulah handed down to him. The liquid smells pepper-minty and delicious, and Hector feels a rush of optimism. Perhaps this is it! He takes the bowl in his hand and offers a sniff to Zephir, his big striped cat. Zephir's first sniff sends him into a spiral of sneezes. He sniffs the potion once more, then lies down on his back with his feet directly in the air. Hmmmm. Must need some work, thinks Hector. He adjusts the quantities, replaces some of the peppermint with other Christmas ingredients. He looks at Zephir and lets out a joyful shout. 

                Licorice, chocolate chips, cinnamon, star anise powder, three drops of Ayahuasca, a drop of the small seed of Nahele, and two drops of moonflower. He discovered the Christmas Spirit elixir formula!

                Using colored paper from his mother’s desk, Hector cuts, folds, and glues. He makes thirty red, green, blue, yellow, and purple envelopes into which he carefully applies two drops of Christmas Spirit elixir. On each card, he places a sticker of a little elf with a sentence written in capital letters.

                The next day after lunch, Hector gets on his bike. Along each street in the village, he slips a colored envelope under the door of the first house on both the left and right side of every street. Once he finishes all his rounds, Hector returns home. He sits down on his bed and waits. When it's 5 o’clock, he tip-toes downstairs, checks to make sure that no one is looking, then quietly opens the front door and slips outside. Then Hector then walks back into the house, pretending to have just returned home and discovered the little red letter. “Mom, Dad, Yohan, come quick!” He calls. 

                When all four of them are standing together in the living room, Hector reads the label aloud. “Open this letter as a family. After opening me, you should close me again and slip me under the door of the neighbor to your right.”

                The family bubbles with curiosity. Hector's mother grabs the envelope and opens it. A strong scent of chocolate, spice, and incense floats across the living room. Hector's parents and brother stand completely still as the delicious scent surrounds them. Suddenly they begin to move, their eyes sparkling, large smiles slowing spreading across their faces. Hector's father begins to dance, grabbing Hector's mother's hand and twirling her to music only they can hear. They both hum and looking lovingly into one another's eyes. Yohan grabs Hector and lifts him above his head, then begins to spin him around as he used to do when Hector was little. 

                “How about we take the scooters to go look at some Christmas decorations around town?” Hector's mother blurts out, smiling from ear to ear. 

                The family bundles themselves in hats and scarves and coats and rush outside. His brother takes the red scooter, and his father the blue one.

                “Come on, princess, get into my carriage.” Hector's father says to Hector's mother. 

                “Wait!” his mother says. She runs back into the house and grabs the red envelope. When she comes out into the cold again, her husband and two sons are circling around on their scooters. 

                Hector's mother runs across the lawn and stuffs the letter underneath the neighbor's door. She rings doorbell three times and shouts, “Merry Christmas!”

                Then all four of them speed down the street, Hector holding on to his big brother's waist and Hector's mother holding onto Hector's father. Both scooters slide over a large patch of ice, then shoot quickly into a pile of snow. Hector's parents roar with laughter. Hector holds his brother tight.

                Everywhere they go, the village is topsy-turvy. Hector chuckles to himself. His elixir is working! Mrs. Gari and Mrs. Dubois have finally stopped arguing and are building a snowman together, their cheeks rosy with laughter.  The mailman has switched out his black coat for a bright red one. His mailbag filled with candy, and he shouts "Merry Christmas!" as he slings sweet treats out to everyone he passes. On Lilas Street, the family joins an enormous snowball fight. Grown-ups and children alike launch snowballs at one another. Everyone is dodging, jumping, laughing and rolling. On Cerfs Street, a group is playing hide-and-seek among the piles of snow they were once preoccupied with removing from their walkways. Others are sledding, and others are blowing up balloons and releasing them into the chilly afternoon air. Delicious aromas of hot chestnuts, crepes, and nougat float throughout the village. At the large church down the hill, the carousel is all lit up and spinning around. Mostly adults are on it and bob up and down to the happy sound of the music. Hector's father and mother rush over to the merry-go-round. Hector spots his teacher on the ride, sitting in a big fire truck. Hector waves to him with a huge smile.

                His brother walks towards him holding two huge servings of cotton candy. They both sit down on the bench across from the dazzling Christmas tree. While enjoying his treat, Hector smiles. In all the eyes that meet his, there is that little spark that shines, a little spark of happiness that tastes like childhood. “Thank you, Tallulah,” he whispers quietly.

                Today is Ruby’s eighth birthday. Ruby does not know that her parents have arranged a circus party at her grandparents' house. Many of Ruby’s friends are invited to the party. Her little brother John helped his mum make the cake and the cupcakes.

                When Ruby woke up, she yawned. “It’s my birthday today,” she said. She ran down from her room into the kitchen. When Ruby’s mum heard her she hid the cake and the cupcakes. “Happy Birthday Ruby, we are going to take you to a surprise outing today.” “Yes!” Ruby cried, she was so excited.

                Ruby ran to her room and put on her gold sparkly dress, her gold sparkly shoes and a gold headband. She wore her favourite butterfly necklace. It was then time to go.

                Ruby hopped into the car and was amazed as there were balloons and streamers, and her seat was decorated in gold sparkles like a throne. Ruby wondered where her mum, dad and brother were taking her. As she looked outside the window she saw a beautiful rainbow in the bright blue sky, twinkling through the branches. “Hang on a minute,” Ruby said when the car stopped. "We are at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.” Grandma and Grandpa greeted Ruby outside the house. “Happy Birthday Ruby, please come inside,” they said.

                As Ruby walked inside the house she saw steamers and balloons everywhere. Ruby then walked into the backyard and was startled when she saw a big red tent with blue and yellow spots. “What is that? Oh my goodness, it’s a circus,” she cried. She walked into the tent and gasped as she saw many of her school friends. She saw Abigail, Amelia, Ella, Zara, Holly, Hannah, Abby, Elie, Cameron, Monique, Amy, Stephanie, Olivia, Maddison, Brianna, Isabella and her bestfriend Grace. They were all so excited to see Ruby.

                Ruby and her friends ran outside and started playing with her grandparents' dog, Rusty. Rusty was a nice puppy dog that didn’t bite anyone but loved to bite the red striped socks on the washing line.

                The big Jacaranda tree was decorated with sparkly streamers. Under the tree there was a picnic blanket set up with a plate of sandwiches for her and her friends. They all sat together and enjoyed their lunch. Once they finished they heard Grandma call out, “Its time for the circus.” They ran into the tent.

                Inside the tent they saw Grandma dressed as an Acrobat and Grandpa was dressed like a Ringmaster. They started to giggle. A man then walked into the tent with two ponies. Grandpa and the man helped all the children have turns riding on the ponies. After everyone had a turn on the pony, a lady walked in with a big trapeze. The lady helped Grandma swing on the trapeze. Everybody cheered and clapped for Grandma. Then everyone had a turn on the trapeze. They were having a wonderful time.

                When it was time to cut the cake, they all went outside where they saw a big pink circus cake set up on a table under the sparkly tree. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to Ruby. They all had a piece of cake and cupcakes with ice-cream.

                When everyone had left, Ruby ran up to her mum, dad, brother, grandma and grandpa and told them that it was the best birthday she had every had and gave them lots of hugs and kisses.

            story2="""About six months ago, the supervisor of one of my teams left. Since all my other managers were very busy, I stepped in to oversee the team operationally. I was rather rusty and there were many challenges in the team that we needed to conquer and I was a bit overwhelmed. But more about that another one.

                Lisa was a relatively new team member. She was the quiet one in team meetings, slow in adapting to changes and somewhat lacking confidence in her abilities. Due to the changes in the team, I really needed her to step up and expand the scope of her activities. I started to progressively give her new tasks so as not to overwhelm her. However, she kept showing silent or sometimes not so silent resistance to any new activity type, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated.

                After one particularly aggravating incident when she called in sick 30 min after I gave her a new task, I knew we could no longer continue this way. I was planning to have a very tough talk with her and tell her off.

                Fortunately, just then, the Harvard Business Review’s “Why leading with compassion is a better managerial tactic than toughness” article came to me in one of a multitude of serendipitous moments that are sprinkled through my life. It reminded me of something that I already knew well but had for a moment, forgotten in my anger – compassion in leadership promotes employee trust and loyalty.

                With my regained balance, I called her and we started talking. It was still a difficult conversation centered around two areas – what are the reasons for her resistance and what she wants to achieve in our team. Lisa shared that she was a perfectionist and had a strong fear of not completing her tasks as per my expectations and the training she received for her new activities was not sufficient to make her feel confident. She also complained that her current workload does not allow her to take on anything new (which was partially true). She had big ambitions for professional growth, but she did not seem to make the connection that to achieve them, she would need to keep expanding her responsibilities and learning new things. I directed the conversation there and clearly told her that she could not expect growth within my team unless she steps up. It was a stern message to deliver, and I am sure – a difficult one to hear.

                After the conversation, I arranged additional training for her and redistributed some of her work, but honestly, I was not sure she would make it. She had to overcome a deeply instilled fear of failure, and I could not predict whether she would manage.

                Time passed, their new supervisor joined and I stepped back. I could not observe Lisa’s progress very closely anymore, but I noticed that she is taking on more and more responsibilities. I was hesitant to broach the subject with her because I was afraid I would jinx her headway.

                Until a couple of weeks ago, when we had our regular skip-level meeting and she started the conversation with, “Marta, I have been waiting for this conversation. I wanted to tell you that I am not afraid of new things anymore. I realized that the only way you develop is by learning new things. And now when there is a new task, I just go, “bring it on.””

                Let me tell you – I did not stop smiling for three days after that. Fear of failure is one of the most crippling emotions one can experience. And I should know – I have been battling it all my life. But Lisa had managed to shift her focus to her desire for success instead and to keep moving forward. I see a bright future for her in our team.

                Vulnerability is risky on many levels. And it does not help that as managers, we are often taught that vulnerability is a sign of weakness and can damage our professional reputation. Melinda was brought up as a leader in precisely that way. She thought she should focus all work interactions entirely on operational tasks, issues and resolutions. While she gladly accepts others’ vulnerability and is very attuned to their emotions, sharing her own goes against her professional image of herself.

                This approach has brought her excellent results and much success. Still, over time she started realizing that she is not getting everything she needed from her relationships with her manager, her team and her colleagues. She often felt misunderstood and increasingly unhappy.

                Progressively, despite her conditioning to always seem in control and never talk about her own emotions and needs, she started realizing that she would never achieve full job satisfaction unless she opened up. And since this required a great leap of courage, she did it in one big move – in the course of one week, she had meetings with her manager, her team and some of her stakeholders. During those meetings, she, for the first time, managed to express her own feelings and intimate thoughts about her work relationships and her job. She talked about the issues she struggled with and showed up as a human being and not just a manager and professional.

                Since this is not a fairy tale, I cannot lie that everything magically changed after those meetings and now all those relationships are perfect and completely satisfactory for her. But she did open doors for conversations that would never be possible before, and that could eventually lead her to a place of comfort and trust.

                Now, I am often annoyed at people who quote their children and find some profound and deep meaning in everything the kid does or says. But my son is special and very wise (ask anyone who knows him).

                Three years ago, he and his friends encountered an aggressive dog and overnight, he was utterly terrified of anything with a tail. He would cross the street if he would see even a puppy approaching and if a dog got near him, he would scream and jump a mile high.

                This went on for a few months and then Benton appeared. Benton was a small white dog with a brown tail and was my son’s first imaginary friend (he read this and said that Benton was brown with a white rump, but that is not how I remember it). Later he had others too – a cat, a horse, a tiger, an invisible boy. At some point, they went up to eight and it was pretty crowded at home. But Benton was the first one and stayed with us the longest. My son was able to explain what the dog was currently doing at any given moment, and we talked about him often. We even wrote one and a half books about him (I got lazy after that).

                Over time, when we met a dog, after the initial scream, he would look at it and start finding similarities with Benton and show more and more interest in dogs. Two years after Benton came into our lives, my son was able to spend time with dogs and even play with them occasionally. He is still not their biggest fan (we are cat people in our house), but he feels quite comfortable with our friends’ very real dog who lives in our shared yard.

                There is a technique widely used in cognitive therapy called desensitization. It involves controlled exposure to anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus, starting with low intensity and increasing it gradually. I had tried to do that with real dogs, but apparently, no matter how slowly I thought I was moving, it was still too much for him. So he decided to start his desensitization himself with something he can bear – an imaginary dog.

                See, I told you he was wise.

                Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.

                One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.

                "A great many times, Marina," answered her Aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment".

                Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?

                "I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened".
                "It's true!" said Marina, intrigued, "Can you tell me that secret?"
                "Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear".

She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this. When her parents took her to bed, she herself put out the light. After a little while, she felt afraid of one of the shadows in the bedroom. Following the advice of Aunt Valerie, she closed the eyes of her face and opened the eyes of her hands. And, summoning up all her courage, she went over to touch that mysterious shadow...

                You have just one more chance to prove you can do it”, the words of my instructor echoed and reechoed in my ears as I got into the plane. Fear was a natural thing, I had heard and I had a common fear which a lot of others had: I was afraid of heights. I had been afraid of even looking down from a high building.

                This fear had been with me from as long as I could remember. It was to overcome my crippling fear of heights that I had decided to join the parachute school. I had gone through a vigorous routine to prepare myself for the big moment. Than at the signal to jump, I had shivered and trembled and started screaming in fear. The instructor had taken me by the hand and led me back into the plane. I was the only one that day who had taken off in the plane and landed-instead of jumping out of it in a parachute. As my companions met me at the base they smirked. I could see that even my good friends were uncomfortable in my presence. I was a failure.

                Then my instructor took me aside. He explained that it was not rare to be afraid. The real valor was in facing and overcoming the fear. I nodded and began to engage in self-talk. In the plane I was still doing this. I kept thinking how I was going to go home and face my parents if I did not get my wings. Then I tried to shutout the fear by imagining myself showing them my wings. The time for the jump grew near.

                The instructor placed his arm on my shoulder to reassure me that I could do it. I nodded and swallowed. My mouth felt dry as I felt the fear arising within me, shiver ran down my spines. I began mumbling affirmations again and then it was my turn. “Jump!” I heard the command and hesitated. “Jump!” shouted the instructor again. I thought no further and took the plunge fairly as I had been drilled.”Bravo” I heard my instructor’s voice in my ears. I fell swiftly and then looked up just in time to see the parachute canopy open above me. Then I looked down.

                As I looked at the beautiful scenario below me, tears glittered into my deep blue eyes, tears of pure joy. I had won. As I floated I remembered all my drills again and began to control my gliding. When I landed, my comrades were upon me laughing and shouting. I could see that they were as contented as I was that I had overcome the greatest enemy of man that is fear.

                Later my instructor landed and gave me a large grin.”I knew you could do it,” he said as he slapped my back, His face beamed with astonishment and mirth. I mumbled my thanks as a smile creased my face and then we ran to the truck with a tremendous feeling of elation.

                “When do we do it again, sir?” I asked the instructor. His reply was drowned in the shouting of my comrades.

                David had avoided flying on airplanes for most of his life because he found himself terrified of crashing. “I couldn’t stop thinking about all the disasters I heard about on the news, and every time I thought about flying, I would begin sweating and my heart started pounding. I only felt better by avoiding travel altogether.”

                But as time went on, David’s fear began to prevent him from doing things he wanted to do. He missed his niece’s graduation and an important work conference, and his fear prevented him from taking his family on the vacation to the coast. “After years of avoidance, I realized this fear was holding me back, and I had to do something about it.”

                David met with a therapist, who encouraged him to examine his thoughts about flying and to question their basis in reality. After some research, David had to admit that his fears about plane crashes were greatly exaggerated in his mind—the flight industry is extraordinarily safe, and accidents are rare. The therapist also taught David some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and visualization, that he could use any time he felt afraid.

                David decided to stop avoiding his fear, and he booked tickets to take his family on their dream vacation. As the flight took off, David focused on keeping his breathing calm and even. Whenever thoughts about crashing entered his mind, he replaced them with a positive thought about how much fun he would have with his family when they arrived. He closed his eyes and imagined the warm sand and waves lapping at his feet, his children laughing and building a sand castle. As the flight progressed, David began to relax. He even enjoyed looking out the window a bit. Anytime he felt himself getting nervous, he gently turned his attention back to his breathing until the feeling passed.

                When the wheels touched the ground, he felt something more powerful than relief: “I felt so proud that I had faced my biggest fear head-on. As we landed, I felt like this thing that had such a powerful hold on me for so long had finally loosened its grip. I knew that I would probably still feel some anxiety when flying, but now I had the tools to face it with mindfulness. I finally feel free.”

            story4="""Once a beggar was upset with his life because he had to beg to run his life. He had to beg for everything. He would remain unhappy about this and thought about how his life would change? Thinking that he would be disappointed.

                Every day he would see that many frustrated people, people with tears in their eyes and troubled by various worries were going towards Gautam Buddha and they were very happy while returning. That beggar could not understand what Gautam Buddha used to do to them so that they would become very happy? While returning there was neither a lot of money in the hands of the people nor gold and silver, then what happened that people were so happy while returning from Buddha?

                Thinking all this, the beggar also decided that he too will go to Mahatma Buddha and see what is happening there that unhappy people go to him and become happy?

                He walked to meet Buddha. Where Buddha was present, there was a very long queue, so that beggar also got in the queue. He started waiting in the queue for his turn. His turn came and he reached near Buddha.

                He said to Buddha, “Buddha I am very poor. I have nothing. I have to beg others even to run my life. Now you tell me that how can I live my life and how can I do it better? “

                On hearing all this the Buddha said, “You are not poor. You think so because till date you have never done anything for anyone. Neither have you ever donated anything to anyone. Nor have you done anything for others.”

                Hearing all this, the beggar was in dilemma. To allay his confusion, the beggar asked, “I am a beggar. How can I donate to people and help people? I have to ask others to run my own life.”

                After hearing all this, Gautam Buddha kept quiet for a while and then said to him, “You have a hand with which you can serve people and do good to others. Also you have mouth so that you say good things and encourage others. You can help others by doing all this. It is not necessary that donations be made only with money. We can also donate education if we want. If the God has given someone a perfectly good body, then he is not poor. He is simply poor in mind. He should move away from this thought and serve others. “

                After listening to all these things of Buddha, that beggar became very happy and his mind was satisfied now.

                Moral of the story – We all waste time worrying that we are poor but this is not true. The truth is that as long as our body is completely better, we can use it to move forward and improve our life. If a person just pays attention to his poverty and does not try to change it then he is a fool.

                Apart from this, we also learn from this story that donations, not only money, education, food, good thoughts, etc. should also be made. If you do not have money, you can education others or you can also share good thoughts to others. This makes society better.

                There was a garden near the palace of King Śuddhodana(Father of Gautam Buddha) where Siddharth used to sit and enjoy nature. One day while he was sitting in his garden, an injured swan fell near his leg. There was an arrow in his body. On seeing the swan, it seemed that some hunter has hunted him.

                Seeing the swan in trouble and seeing it fluttering, Siddhartha’s heart melted and he wanted to help the swan.

                He first took that arrow from the body of that swan and bandaged it with ointment on the injured place. After doing all this, Devdutt came to Siddharth looking for something.

                As soon as Devdutt approached Siddhartha, he said, “Well, it is with you. Bring it to me. I have hunted it. I had to work very hard to hunt it and I have the right to it.”

                On hearing this, Siddharth said to Devadatta, “No, this swan was injured and came to me. I helped it and saved his life. That’s why I have the right over it.”

                There was a debate between the two brothers over the rights of that goose. Now they wanted to know who has more right over that swan? So both of them decided that both of them would go to the king. Siddhartha’s father was the king of Kapilavastu.

                They both went to the king Śuddhodana. As soon as they reached the king, Devdutt first said, “Maharaj, I have the highest authority over this swan because I have hunted it. Because of this you ask Siddharth to give me this swan.”

                As soon as Devdutt’s point was completed, the king pacified both and then asked him what was the whole matter?

                In such a situation, Siddhartha told the king the whole thing and said to him, “Father the thing is that this swan was hunted by Devdutt but this swan got injured and came near my feet. Seeing it injured, I treated it and fixed it. Now tell me that the highest authority on this goose is mine. “

                The king considered this matter well. After considering it, he said one of the biggest things in the meeting and that was, “the right to save more than the one who is killed is the highest. Therefore, the biggest authority over this swan is only and only for Siddhartha because he save that swan. He did not kill it, but treated that swan after seeing it injured and saved its life. After the king had said this, Devdutt understood the matter very well. He also knew that the protector has more rights than the one who killed.

                Moral of the story- From this story we understand that the protector is greater than the one who kill and his authority is greater than the one who is killed. That is why we too should help others and help the troubled people. By doing this we make the society around us better. A good society is the hallmark of a good country. That’s why you also pledge from today that you too will definitely help others.

                The disciple gladly obliged and walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that a few people were washing their clothes in the lake and right at that moment, a bullock cart was crossing through the lake. As a result, the water had become muddy and foul. The disciple couldn’t possibly take the dirty water to Buddha. So he returned to Buddha and told him the water was dirty and not fit to drink.

This time, however, the disciple noticed that the water was crystal clean. The mud had settled down and the water was fit to drink. So he collected some water in a pot and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the pot of water and smiled.

                He said, “See what you did to make the water clean? You did nothing. You just let it be. The mud settled on its own and you got pure water. Your mind is exactly like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it some time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put any effort to calm your mind. It will happen. It’s effortless.”

                Buddha’s message is crystal clear. Achieving inner peace is effortless. It is not something to struggle for. It is an effortless process which will happen on its own. The practice of mindfulness is central to Buddhist philosophy where one observes the thoughts without passing any judgment or reacting to them. There are several mindfulness meditation techniques that can help us in achieving a calm and peaceful state of mind.

            story1="""My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter.
                My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter. I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter’s giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through...I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter's giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through her child’s merry eyes.
                We talked about the carefree laughter of childhood before we had bills to pay and so many responsibilities.
                I asked my daughter, "So what makes you laugh when you get older, and the children are grown, and you no longer have to leave cookies out for Santa?"
                "I don’t know, Mom, she said. That’s what I’m expecting you to show me."
                That’s the thing about children; when you think they are grown and you’ve set good examples for them, they remind you that they’re still watching.
                Our children grew up in a pastor's home with many different kinds of people coming and going in their lives in many different places. Teaching our children to have a sense of humor was just as important as teaching them to have a strong prayer life.
                One of my many favorite memories of laughing together as a pastor's family was when a precious older member of our church, who was almost blind with cataracts, would prepare meals and bring them to us. She didn't realize that she mixed all the food on one big serving plate.
                The fried fish was often on top of cottage cheese and pineapple with beans and slaw on top of that. The children wouldn't eat the food and didn't know what to say when she asked them at church how their dinner was.
                A pastor friend suggested we name our garbage can "Spot." So when the sweet lady asked the kids how the food was, they would say, "It hit the spot!" Laughter always made our lives fun and helped us get through stressful times.
                We need laughter in the good times and the bad. Laughter makes us feel good, releases pressure in a bad situation, gives us energy, and makes the most miserable situation bearable at times. In general, it gives us a sense of well-being and a sense of community.
                Doctor Madan Kataria, author of the book, Laughter Yoga, said, "Children can laugh up to 400 times a day, but for adults, this frequency drops to barely 15 times a day."
                It may even be less this year with all the stress our country and families have been through.
                In 1995 Dr. Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai, India, experimented with humor’s therapeutic benefits by approaching strangers in a park in Mumbai. He then invented a series of breathing and relaxation exercises that stimulate merriment for better health called Laughter Yoga.
                Since then, thousands of social laughter clubs have been launched in 65 countries, including the United States.
                Some physicians prescribe laughter classes to the sick, elderly, young, and healthy for its stress-reducing effects. It is proven that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter.
                The physical benefits of laughter include reducing stress hormones, strengthening our immune system, cardiac conditioning, lower blood pressure, {especially in women), and it cleanses the lungs, which can aid in respiratory problems.
                Good reason to add laughter to our lives daily, right?
                When I added up the amount of laughter in my life, I found that most of the people I spend time with are people who like to laugh.
                As inspiration, I look no further than my own friends and family. My neighbor and friend is one particular person who inspires me. She is engaged, curious, strong, beautiful, and fun at age 89 ? exactly the kind of woman I'd love to be when I'm her age, should I have the good fortune to live that long in fine health.
                Listening to her share funny stories of stressful times in her life growing up during the great depression reminds me that there is a funny side to every situation. Spending any time with her reinforces the idea that we need a sense of humor to make it through the tough times in life and gives me new energy and hope for the future.
                My sisters, who were all more than ten years older than me, inspired me the same way. They knew how to use laughter as a healing agent. When we got together, we talk about our life as children. There were sad and painful times for us, but we always managed to turn our shared stories and thoughts into laugher that brought tears to our eyes.
                During the Covid-19 quarantine, I had an amazing friend who sent me videos of funny things and attitudes to cope with the quarantine. She says we need more comedy in our lives, and she is right. The videos were respectfully humorous, and they helped me laugh at myself.
                Laughter doesn’t mean you can’t be serious or that you are insensitive to the bad things happening in the world around us.
                However, it can be the difference between a life of black-and-white and a life filled with color. Laughter may not add years to your life, but it will add life to your years! It’s like a flower that blooms when it stretches towards the sun.
                A wise person realizes eating right and exercise is the best way to stay healthy, and it is a wise person who learns the importance of laughter in their lives.
                If we need a prescription for laughter, it can be found in a book that has been around a long, long time. A Bible verse in Proverbs reminds us that joy is an important part of a healthy life. "A merry heart is good like a medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength." (17:22, NLT)
                Laughing with our grandchildren is the most fun, and we do it a lot. Sometimes when our grandchildren get into trouble, we laugh and remind our children they did the same things when they were that age. But, for some reason, they don't always think that's funny.
                However, being a role model for our adult children has meant demonstrating how to live well and happy in good times and bad. Teaching them always to have a sense of humor and a strong prayer life will be their guide to setting the same example for their children."""
            story2="""Many frogs lived in the Champakan pond. Kanduk was a jovial frog. He loved to make other frogs laugh.
                Many frogs lived in the Champakan pond. Kanduk was a jovial frog. He loved to make other frogs laugh. One day, while Kanduk was entertaining his friends in the pond, King Sher Singh came there to have a bath. Unfortunately, the king stepped on one of Kanduk’s legs and it broke. Kanduk screamed in pain. The king immediately admitted him to the hospital for treatment.
                The Minister of Laughs
                Doctor Bhola, the bear had to replace Kanduk’s leg with a wooden leg. Kanduk practised using his artificial leg and soon got used to it. Now wherever he went, he would praise his wooden leg a lot. Once Kanduk’s friend Champa, the squirrel was unwell. She was down with typhoid and was admitted to the hospital. When Kanduk heard about it, he went to visit her along with his brother Tandul.
                The hospital was crowded with patients and visitors. Kanduk decided to entertain all the patients and began narrating the story about his wooden leg. He said, “Having a wooden leg has its benefits. It cannot get injured and so does not pain!”  Then he called a patient and gave him a stick. “Hit and see.” That patient, Uluk hit Kanduk’s leg with all his might. Kanduk started laughing. He said, “See, I didn’t get hurt.” Everybody smiled looking at Kanduk. After visiting Champa, Kanduk and Tandul returned home. Kanduk began stroking his leg. Seeing this, Tandul asked, “What happened?”  “Uluk hit me on my real leg by mistake. If I wouldn’t have laughed, how would I have brought smiles on so many faces? It was a small price to pay to make others laugh.” said Kanduk and laughed out loud. Tandul was amazed and said “You are great! Kanduk. You can laugh despite the pain. Laughter is the best Medicine.”

            story3="""Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as “terminally ill”. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500.
                He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, “If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?”
                He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find – Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something funny.
                His pain was so great he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
                He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy, healthy and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
                Some people think laughter is a waste of time. It is a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to indulge in only every so often.
                Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we’re not well, laughter helps us get well; if we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
                Since Cousins’ ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind and the emotions.
                So, if you like laughter, consider it sound medical advice to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don’t like laughter, then take your medicine – laugh anyway.
                Use whatever makes you laugh – movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, New Yorker cartoons, jokes, friends.
                Give yourself permission to laugh – long and loud and out loud – whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you’re strange, but sooner or later they’ll join in even if they don’t know what you’re laughing about.
                Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure. . . laughter.

            story5="""“G’day.” He sat down next to her. The prohibited 1.5 metres or whatever the heck that is in feet.
                “Oh. Hello.” She tried to sound normal. She didn’t feel normal. She felt like she was teetering on the edge of something. That feeling where you’re not sure if it’s laughter or tears — both hysterical — that will come out of your body.
                “I’m lichen it.” His voice was deep, laconic. Australian.
                “What?” Her brow furrowed. The green mask hid her mouth.
                “I’m lichen it.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. The weird feeling was still there. Tears? Laughter? She wasn’t sure, but when it came, she knew she’d have no control. None.
                You see, she’d been locked inside her two-roomed ‘palace’ for 21 days. The whole weird world lockdown had triggered her already fragile self into going into herself, into self-isolation. For longer than 14 days because…well…you never can tell. I mean, perhaps she had touched a metal hand-rail when she took the train, or when she’d walked into the toilets at the cinema. There were germs everywhere. And now they had a name.
                “Barry.” She looked at him, fully into his face, her mouth a little slack with surprise. Her eyes, wide.
                “What?” She wondered if he some kind of telepathy.
                “My name. Barry. And I’m lichen it!” He grinned at her. The lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. And his eyes twinkled. The smile was cheeky. He had no mask. Brave. His brown hair flopped onto his forehead. He had a black t-shirt on, AC/DC on the front.
                She must have looked a little puzzled. Although he could only see her eyes, they must have shown her confusion. He started to laugh. It was a deep laugh. Straight from his belly. It was lovely!
                “The bench! We’re sitting on…” he gesticulated. His hands were broad and capable. Clean too. Fingernails, neat. Blonde hairs on the backs of his hand glistened in the sun.
                It was then she noticed. She who notices everything. Every hair follicle. Every leaf on every tree. Every blade of grass. Every freckle dusting Barry’s arm.
                The bench was covered in lichen!
                She felt it. Not the lichen but the laughter. Bubbling up, like a soda bottle, shaken not stirred. It bubbled up and up and out of her! Such laughter, a beautiful sound! A beautiful feeling! The lichen!

                She pulled at the mask hiding her mouth, gulping the air as the laughter came, flowing like a stream.
                How could she be laughing? With a stranger? On a park bench? At this time in the world’s history?
                But it wouldn’t be stopped. It flowed! Her every nerve, cell, neuron, given life by laughter, glowed in the sunlight. She put the mask down next to her.
                “So, you’re a lichen expert then,” she chortled, leaning over with the laughter pouring out of her. He began to laugh too.
                “I know what I’m lichen,” he replied, “And I’m lichen you!” His whole face contorted as his laughter burst out of him! He slapped his thigh, leaning backward and forwards as the hilarity took control of him.
                She tried to reply, feeling the peeling lichen under her hands. Laughter had taken control of her. All her fears disappeared in wave after wave of glorious giggles.
                She stood up, held her hand out to him.
                “Come on, Barry! I’m lichen you too! Let’s make like a tree and leave!” She let out a huge gust of laughter. Barry grabbed her hand and stood up, laughing his wonderful belly laugh.
                They wandered off. Who knows where? Nothing was open so perhaps they went back to her place. She left the mask behind.

            story11="""he doorbell rang in the late afternoon. A bearded man, dressed in a dark blazer and pants, handed Mom a large garbage bag. “Your mister ordered these,” he said, then turned and left.
                Mom dragged the sack into the kitchen of our home in suburban Sherwood Park, Alta. My 10-year-old brother came into the room: “What’s in there? It’s moving.”
                I gave a piercing, seven-year-old-girl shriek. Something in the lumpy bag was struggling to escape. Mom spun around. “Oh, shi—shoot. Take it to the garage.”
                My brother hauled the bag away. In the garage, Mom grabbed the axe from its spot on the wall. Dark-jacketed men, mysterious packages and now axes, I thought. It was turning out to be an interesting day.
                Mom approached the bag like a bomb-squad member, opened the top and retreated a few feet. There was a rustle and then a chicken with a partially detached head blasted out. Dad was a thrifty man, unable to resist the Hutterite’s price for unplucked, freshly killed (or, in this case, mostly killed) poultry.
                The chicken, delighted to be free of the cramped bag and its deceased kin, made several leaps around our garage, like a spasmodic ballerina. Mom’s former-farm-girl know-how abandoned her, and she looked a little sick. She handed my brother (whose closest experience with a live chicken was an undercooked nugget) the axe. “Chop its head off,” she said.
                “Okay.” He took a half step forward, turned pale, then handed the axe back. “You chop it off.”
                The hen ran in enthusiastic circles, letting out garbled squawks, more bothered by captivity than its neck problem. It darted toward us, wings flapping, feathers shedding. We all screamed and tried to hide behind one another. The bird darted away, terrified. Mom admitted defeat, herded us inside and called my father. Until he arrived, she eyed the door as though the chicken might grab the axe itself and hack its way through.
                Hours later, I snuck out to the garage. No more chicken, and the axe was back on the wall. When I asked Dad what happened to the animal, he told me it had run away.
                For months I watched in vain for a droopy-headed chicken lurking in the neighbourhood. To my dad’s credit, no more dark-suited men carrying bags ever arrived at our door again. And, many years later, my brother, still horrified, exclaims, “Mom handed me the axe.”

They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.


                        That is how generous my mother is. She gives all she has to us, and more.

So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.

                        Mother's brother
                        Took me in as his daughter
                        Wiped the tears from my face

                        Giving God praise for letting him stay in my life another day
                        My protector when life gets rough
                        No one can break our bond, because it's strong and tough
                        In his eyes he reveals a secret

                        It was a crisp morning on June 15th,2005 when I got a call from my father, “Its a girl” he said. My joy knew no bounds and I danced around my balcony announcing the news of the new arrival to my neighbors.         
                        My elder sister, Smitha(26yrs), delivered a girl on June 15th,2005. It was such a blessing for all of us. She stayed with us through her pregnancy and it was a wonderful bonding time for us. I would take care of her sleep, food, etc and be extra cautious to her. I even decorated my room with posters showcasing ‘cute’ babies.
                        I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                        I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                        It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                        I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                        I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                        That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                        As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                        She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                        I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                        As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                        People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                        Why, out of all the girls he had, did he have to choose to hurt me?” The girl cried, showed the bruises which she did because of him.She came back to reality as familiar fingers caressed her hair, the other hand tracing patterns on her arm.
                        “Do you want me to be honest?” I asked, wiping her tears, holding her hands. she nodded and moved her head but she wants to listen.
                        “Well..” She began, putting her arms around me in a warm embrace. 
                        “You are innocent. You are beautiful; unused. I think he liked that. All of the other girls he’d met had been screwed over already. But you were pure. Too pure for his dirty hands.”
                        Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                        “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                        She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                        “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                        That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                        Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                        Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                        Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                        I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                        My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                        Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                        “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                        How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                        I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                        And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                        She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                        She will teach me to do the right things,

                        She will guide me through the right path,

                        She will motivate me during my bad times,

                        She will pray for me and for my future,

                        She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                        And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                        Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                        I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                        She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

                I just never knew you would turn out to be so much harmful; else, never I must have bothered to you. A friend would never do something like what you did. I indeed feel unenviable to recollect the fact that we were friends.

                I remember when I first met you. It was quite a sunny day, and our first day at college. Students of the new batch were to assemble in the main hall. It was the first time when I caught a glimpse of you. You were in your red shorts and a plain black t-shirt, with a ponytail and you looked very fine. Some boys even wanted to talk to you. I purposely stood next to you. I genuinely thought you might be a generous girl with a firm attitude. Our college principal began his speech to his New Year students and we stood straight.


                
                Suddenly a choking voice of the microphone came out of the speakers in a very harsh voice, some of the students started laughing about it, and you were one of them. You shouted and howled like a guy, and it was outrageous to see a girl doing such stuff. You suddenly turned to me and laughed, expecting that I too must laugh on this, but I just smiled at you gladly. I was very happy to get your attention, but your behavior wasn’t comforting. I desperately needed a friend in the new college, new town and most importantly a new life after school.

                We were to move back to the mess for the food. I again purposely sat next to you, hoping to have a conversation. You took my presence and began talking to me. Really, you were too amiable to me. You did not let me feel that was our first conversation, especially the way you hit me on my back repeatedly, just as if how usually boys do! I learnt you love sports, and basketball was your game. Well, it was too obvious to know, you were a tomb boy. But whatever you were, I was happy to have a good-looking sport-loving girl as my friend. We exchanged our numbers and came in contact. You lived in the college residence but I lived with my relatives in the town.


                
                Then we kept on meeting very often. Gradually, we went on being good friends. Nevertheless, you made me feel deplorable sometimes the way you dealt with others. You often cracked jokes on others, badgered and annoyed our classmates with your irritating tricks and abused girly girls for the way they dressed themselves. Sometimes, you did not spare even me with your endurable spirit of teasing. People asked me huge times to remain away from you. They all had come to know we didn’t share any single quality and that I was just being nice to you. Unfortunately, their perception was true. Many a times I felt like I should quit your friendship, but one thought always stopped me to proceed, as you were the only friend of mine, who was so popular, handsome and undeniably, my first friend in the college. But it was becoming too harder to remain friends with you.

                After a lot of patience, I decided to get separated from your friendship. I started ignoring you a bit, like if you appeared in my sight, I pretended as if I have not seen you. But I guess you caught me. You soon understood my ignorance. You came to me and directly asked me if there was anything wrong. This one single thing was only appreciating, that you were always straight in your talks. You never tangled the confusions or talked indirectly, which I definitely lacked. I then settled things by providing lame explanations. Somehow you accepted and never bothered about my ignorance as you were too much busy with your sports.


                
                Our first year came near to end. You won us the inter college basketball championship, as the captain. Principal and every one appreciated for your efforts. Really, we all were proud of you. Unluckily our exams were just one month after. You did not study the entire year and were always engaged in your basketball shots and strategies. You were horrified to see such lny syllabus and were all confused. You asked me to help you in studies. I agreed. However, I just did not know you thought me a fool. You wanted me to complete all your assignments and projects. I somehow did. You wanted me to teach you like a tutor, fill your mind with everything given in our textbooks. I agreed to explain you though, but you were not satisfied with whatever I taught you. You treated me very gratingly as if I owed a lot to you. I did every possible thing for you to get ready for exams, but still you were not gratified. You wanted more out of me; you wanted me to give more and more time to you. But I had to study for my exams too.I tried to tell you indirectly that I can’t do anything more than this, but I guess you did not want to understand my problems.


                
                I was extremely chafed by your behavior. I then decided to completely dismiss, no matter what. I began ignoring your calls and messages. I switched off my cell phone. You were annoyed by this attitude of mine and got impatient. You visited me at my place un-announced, and burst in anger. You capper clawed, yelled and abused me as if I did a crime by not giving attention to you. As soon as you left, I uttered a great cry and kept on weeping that whole night.

                We were not friends anymore. I decided never to talk to you, so did you. After that day, we often saw each other; but we turned our heads in other directions each time. Nevertheless, I’m just not hesitant to tell you, that now I actually love life without you. Moreover, I need you to know, that Friend, you are not tolerable!

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...

                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                The battle was going very badly until Patizombi realized that he was in fact not fighting a ghost but a clingy bedsheet he’d been trapped by.

                “Ha, ha, ha! You have fallen right into my trap, you evil zombie!” A ghost laughed, emerging from his hiding spot.

                “Ahh, evil ghost,” Patizombi replied. “I’ll catch you one day.”

                “No, no, no, no and no!” said the ghost, incredibly offended. “Excuse me, but I am a good ghost and my job is to hunt evil zombies.

                “Oh no you don’t!” objected Patizombi, “because I am a good zombie, and I am the one who hunts evil ghosts.”

                After arguing for a little while, they realised they were both telling the truth. They found it funny and became friends.

                “I suppose not all ghosts are evil…”

                “Nor all zombies…”

                “We could join forces to hunt ogres”

                And they headed as a team into the mountains, where the most fearsome ogres were hidden. Working quickly together, they found the track of an ogre that led them to a cave. As the ogre was out, they prepared a trap but while they were doing so a giant stone fell and blocked the entrance leaving them trapped.

                “Ha, ha, ha! it was so easy to trap that evil zombie and his ghostie partner!”

                “Lies!” they protested from inside, “We are not evil. The only evil one is you and we have come to catch you!”

                Once again, the discussion carried on until everyone was persuaded that none of them was evil.

                “We would never have thought that good ogres existed”

                “Neither would I have thought that a zombie and a ghost were not evil”

                It is obvious that, before you set out to hunt anyone, you need to make sure that they are evil...

                That is how they discovered that, even if a creature has a reputation for being evil, it is not always true. And this is also true for all other creatures who have a reputation for being dirty, noisy or annoying: you can never tell which ones are actually like that without first getting to know them. That is how they found many more zombies, ghosts and good ogres who joined their group of catchers of evil creatures. Everyone trusted this valley police force, which never allowed anyone to be treated badly due to prejudice and to bad reputations they did not deserve.

                There was once a fairy who was learning how to be a fairy godmother. Most magic and wonderful, she was the kindest and cleverest of all fairies. However, she was also a very ugly fairy. And no matter how much she showed her wonderful qualities, it seemed that everyone was determined to believe that the most important thing about a fairy was her beauty. In the fairy school they ignored her, and every time she flew off on a mission to help a child or anyone else in trouble, before she could say a word they were already screeching and yelling at her: "Ugly! Get out of here, weirdo!"

                Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful. But then she remembered what her mother had always told her: "My dear, you are what you are, warts and all; and never doubt that you are this way for a very special reason..."

                But then, one day, the witches of the neighbouring land invaded and destroyed the country, putting all the fairies and wizards in prison. Our fairy, just before being attacked, put a spell on her own clothes and, helped by her ugly face, she managed to pass for a witch. That way she was able to follow the witches back to their den.

                Once there she used her magic to prepare a big party for everyone, decorating the cave with bats, toads and spiders. The music was provided by a pack of howling wolves. While the party was in full swing, the fairy hurried off and set free all the fairies and wizards who had been imprisoned. When all of them were free, they worked together on one big spell which succeeded in trapping the witches inside the mountain for the next hundred years. And for the next hundred years, and more, everyone remembered the great bravery and intelligence of the ugly fairy.

                And from that day on no one in that land ever saw ugliness as a disgrace. Whenever someone ugly was born, people were filled with joy, knowing that for that new person great things lay ahead.

                Mr. Horsefly was the new head of the prairie post office. He had put a lot of time and effort into getting this highly respected position; he had even moved fields. If you asked Mr. Horsefly, he would tell you that he got the job thanks to his great deductive gifts.

                On his first day at work, he opened up shop, and into the post office came Mr. Beetle, Mrs Spider, Miss Mantis, and Mr. Grasshopper.
                Mr. Horsefly wouldn't let them so much as open their mouths.

                "Don't tell me, don't tell me. I bet I can work out what each of you came for," he said, putting a book, a plastic mat, a nail file, and some protective goggles on the counter.

                "The nail file will be for Mrs. Spider, without a doubt. With all the scratching she does, she'll need to put her nails right. “The mat”, he went on, without giving anyone time to react, "without even having to think about it, I give it to Mr. Grasshopper, since he must have to train pretty hard to keep all his hopping about up to a decent standard. The safety goggles have to be for Mr. Beetle, because having to spend all day with his face so close to the ground, he'll be needing something to protect his eyes. And finally, this big book here, has to be a Bible. I'll have to give that to Miss Praying Mantis, whom I would like to ask to include me in her supplications to The Almighty. As you will see..."

                They didn't let him finish. The comment about the mantis - well known on the prairie for having changed her name from Miss Praying Mantis to simply Miss Mantis - was just too much for everyone, and they burst out laughing...

                "Not much of a detective, are you!" said Mr. Grasshopper, between chuckles. "For a start, Mrs. Spider came for the book. She's very quiet, and doesn't scratch a soul. The mat is for Mr. Beetle, who likes to sunbathe in his swimming pool, and do it lying on his back. Miss Mantis will, of course, want the nail file. She's a bit of a flirt, you know. And the protective goggles are for me. I'm not as young as I was, and don't see to well. These days when I'm hopping on the grass I get the odd black eye..."

                “Uhu”, Mr. Horsefly interrupted, recovering a little from his embarrassment, "then you do, in fact, hop on grass!"

                "Yes, I do," answered the grasshopper, "but as you'll see, making your deductions based simply on prejudice, leads to more misses than hits..."

                How right he was! Just a few days later, after having met all the insects in person, Mr. Horsefly had a good laugh while telling this story about his deductions made from prejudice without yet having met a soul. And he understood that judging without knowing is a practice for fools.

                XT-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read "XT-27: The best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other XT-27s.

                "All robots should be like us XT-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the XT-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

                One day, he was walking along in Bionic City, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors (that's eyes to you and me, but XT-27 liked to use highly technical sounding words for everything).

                He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an XT-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were XT-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing!

                Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XT-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble (a house), on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were XT-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more.
                On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time.

                So XT-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another XT-27.
                So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push...
                When he woke up, the XT-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The XT-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The XT-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "XT-28, the best, most modern robot".
                So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The XT-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn't feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points.

                That first night he was paralysed with fear, his mind full of monsters. So much so, that he went over to his wardrobe to get a torch. But when he opened the wardrobe door he came face to face with a monster, and he let out the loudest scream in the world.

                The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and... started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there.

                The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair.

                The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons... It was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends.

                And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.

He cast a spell, and from that moment, every insult they directed at the old man made the old man better, but had the opposite effect on the goblin who was doing the insulting. Of course, the goblins knew nothing about what was happening. The more they called the man an "old fool", the younger and sharper of mind he became, while the goblin who had shouted at him aged rapidly, and became a little more foolish.

                Reggie couldn't hear a thing. He was a normal boy, but he had been born deaf. He was well known to everyone in town, and they were all very fond of him. Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby.

                Reggie didn't like this very much. But the person who disliked it the most was his friend Michael, who decided one day that things had to change. Michael's father was the town´s Mayor, and Michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of Reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs.

                People liked the idea, because everyone loved Reggie. The day became known as The Day of Silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: Reggie was amazing!

                On that day no one was thinking of Reggie as just a deaf person. This meant he could be treated just like any other little boy; and people saw a whole new side of him. Not only that, but Reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, Reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all Reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference.

                So the Day of Silence was the day Reggie´s true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head. A helmet with great thick ear flaps; a helmet which meant you couldn't hear the slightest thing.

                Pete Sparks was a sensitive boy. So sensitive that even his hair was ticklish. You only had to touch his hair a little bit and he would burst out laughing. And when this ticklish laughter started, no one could make him stop.

                So Pete grew up used to strange situations. When his granny’s friends came to visit, he would always end up in stitches because there was never any shortage of little old ladies rubbing his head and saying “How cute!”

                Windy days were the worst, with Pete on the ground, paralyzed by laughter whenever the breeze blew on his locks, which, incidentally, were pretty long because at the barber shop no one could manage to cut his hair, due to the non-stop giggling. To see Pete laugh, as well as being great fun, was terribly contagious. When Pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing.

                As Pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places. Some activities are serious business, and cannot be done amid gales of laughter. So Pete tried everything to control his ticklishness: he tried wearing a thousand different hats, he used ultra strong hairsprays and gels, he shaved his head, and he even went on a yoga course to see if he could bear the tickling by learning to relax himself.

It didn’t take long to make Pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown.

                “I have no one to replace me”, said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do”. Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought “serious? A clown?”, trying to understand what the old man had told him.

                “Come, I’ll show you” said the clown.

                So the clown took Pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show Pete’s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter.

                When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at Pete and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age”.

                “It’s true,” answered Pete, smiling and returning the wink, “not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. And that’s so hard to find”. This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter.

                And that is how Pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that Pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days. While they were traveling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.

                The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha, The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.

                After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.

                Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.

                What did Buddha emphasize here? He said, It is effortless. Having 'peace of mind' is not a strenuous job; it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment, such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.

                YET, LOVE DID NOT WISH TO FLEE QUICKLY. THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO. BUT AS THE CLOUDS DARKENED, LOVE REALISED IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE. ALAS, THERE WERE NO BOATS TO SPARE. LOVE LOOKED AROUND WITH HOPE.

                One picture was of a calm lake. The lake was a perfect mirror for peaceful towering mountains were all around it. Overhead was a blue sky with fluffy white clouds. All who saw this picture thought that it was a perfect picture of peace.

                The other picture had mountains too. But these were rugged and bare. Above was an angry sky from which rain fell, in which lightening played. Down the side of the mountain tumbled a foaming waterfall. This did not look peaceful at all.

                But when the King looked, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in the midst of the rush of angry water, sat the mother bird on her nest ... perfect peace.

                Which picture do you think won the prize?

                The King chose the second picture.

                Do you know why?

                "Because," explained the King, "peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard work. Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart. That is the real meaning of peace."

            story5="""One day the most peaceful inhabitants from the Earth asked one very powerful wizard to stop all wars and bloodshed on the planet.

                – It is simple, – he said. — I will destroy all weapons on the Earth, and nobody will be able to fight anymore.

                – It would be great! –people exclaimed.

                The magic wand’s wave – and this was done.

                There was a peace on the planet for three days, while the majority of those who were prone to fight, sought and could not find a weapon. When they understood they’ve lost it forever, they have made spears of young trees and started to fight again.

                When the wizard heard this bad news, he said:

                – Do not worry. I will destroy all young trees, so that they will not be able to fight.

                After two or three days of useless search for young trees, suitable for making spears, rebellious people started to cut giant trees, make batons from them, and the bloodshed has started again. The Wizard destroyed all big trees. Then humans made knives and swords of metal. He destroyed all metal on the planet. People made sling and began to throw stones at each other. It was necessary to destroy the stones, too. And then peacekeepers began to worry: all trees have disappeared; there is no metal and stones. How to live, what to eat now? There will be no vegetation soon, and people will die without even fighting. No, this is a wrong solution of the problem.

                The Wizard became confused:

                – I do not know how to behave now. I would have destroyed all humanity, but, unfortunately, it is not in my power!

                The peacekeepers fell into despair; they did not know what to do. And then one clever kid turned to the Wizard.

                – I know what you should do. Let people feel, how others perceive their actions. If one person hurt someone, let him feel the same pain, and if he brings joy to someone, let him feel the same joy. So no one will hurt each other, because he will feel the pain immediately too and would have to stop.

                All people were inspired with the greatness of kid’s thought, and the wizard realized his idea. He returned all trees, stones and metals.

                Since that day nobody on the planet tried to hurt his neighbour, because he would have to feel the same pain too. People began to help each other, because they liked the sense of joy they felt at this moment. And they began to live in harmony and joy.

                Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...
                
                At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                A heart touching STORY - PEACE!! :)

                A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block.
                He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did U take all this time to come? Don’t U know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t U have any sense of responsibility?”
                Th…e doctor smiled & said:”I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call…… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work”
                “Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would U calm down? If your own son dies now what will U do??” said the father angrily.
                The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”
                “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.
                The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,“Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If U have any question, ask the nurse!!”
                “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
                The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”
                The patient father remained speechless.

                There was a monk who lived on the edge of a small town, much to the delight of the townspeople. Whenever he ventured into town to help someone, everyone came out of their homes to give him gifts from their gardens, calling out to him, "Oh, Teacher, we're so fortunate to have you living nearby! You are such a wonderful person! You do so much good, Teacher! Your presence is such a blessing!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                One day a young woman came to the monk's hut and said, "Oh, Teacher, I'm in terrible trouble. I'm pregnant and my family will disown me. The young man who I love so much has fled to another town because my family would certainly do him harm. I have nowhere else to turn and no one else to ask for help."

                The monk replied that she could live in the back room and help around the house and she would then have the security of a home for her child.

                Well, now when the monk went into town, he was reviled. "You dirty old man! Look how you have betrayed our trust and taken advantage of that young woman! How could we have ever believed in you? What shame you have brought on us!" And they hurled rotten fruit at him along with their insults.

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                After a while, the father of the child returned to the town and presented himself before the family, saying, "I have spent the past two years learning a trade in a neighboring town and now I am able to provide a home for your daughter and grandchild." The family was overjoyed. Although it wasn't the best of situations, it was so much better than they had feared that they welcomed their daughter and grandchild back into the family with open arms.

                How different it was when the monk came into town then. The townspeople lined the road every time, presenting him with gifts of food and calling out, "Oh, Teacher, how could we have ever doubted you? Look at the wonderful thing you have done! We are so ashamed! Please forgive us! You are such a wise and compassionate person! We are so fortunate to have you living nearby!"

                To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                While there is no single interpretation that would do justice to this story, it certainly speaks to the equanimity of the monk. Against the backdrop of praise and condemnation, he holds himself apart from "what everyone thinks" even as he acts with the most compassionate and involved sense of responsibility. Whether in public or the workplace or in the privacy of home life, people will misread our intentions and jump to conclusions that cast us in a bad light. The most straight-forward lesson of this story, then, is that by continuing on the most ethical course of action our true intents become known. This, however, can be a short-lived vindication as the same thing may happen all over again: We ought not be pulled off-center by shallow praise any more than by shallow criticism.

                The monk in this story serves as a model by maintaining emotional detachment from the transient opinions of others while never withdrawing from personal involvement with others' real needs

                A woman whose husband died unexpectedly faced dire circumstances. Creditors hounded her, taking everything away from her and her young son. Fearing she might lose the most valuable possession of the family, she hid the priceless jewel that had been handed down for generations by sowing it into the sleeve of an old coat that the creditors would never want. The troubles weighed on her grief and eventually broke her spirit and she died without ever telling her son about the jewel.

                The boy found himself without family or home, his only inheritance the old threadbare coat that the creditors left him. He found work wherever he could, staying in barns or out in the forest, exposed to the elements and grave hardship. Filled with sorrow at his fate, he endured the passing years with an abiding belief in the unfairness of life.

                One day, as he was chopping wood, his sleeve caught on a branch and tore open. Out spilled the priceless jewel onto the ground before him!

                The source of happiness -- real wealth -- is our birthright, something we carry with us from childhood whether we remember it or not. We are rich, the story says, even when we feel deprived. This is because, of course, the jewel represents the perfect nature of the true, original self with which we are born. Upon finding the jewel, the young man realized he had been rich all along -- and his life changed irreversibly in just that single moment of recognizing the jewel.

                Becoming more aware of the hidden jewel we carry at all times brings us in touch with the source of inner peace and happiness. The more we identify with our hidden treasure, the more we become a well of peace and happiness overflowing into the lives of others.

                "No, it is the wind that moves," argued the other group.

                After listening for a while, the itinerant monk interrupted them and said, "If you look more closely you will see that it is neither the flag nor the wind that moves -- what moves is your mind."

                This story is a reminder of how easily we fall into "either-or" thinking. It doesn't matter what the subject is, we are fully capable of taking sides and then feeling the need to prove ourselves "right." The lesson of "seeing ourselves seeing" is a necessary one if we are to develop the witness awareness that watches habit thoughts and feelings arise automatically. Interrupting ingrained reactions to things allows us to consciously create new reactions that better reflect our current stage of development.

                n Ayodhya, there was a beautiful white pigeon. A very special kind. That beautiful white pigeon could fly high in the blue sky up from one tree to another tree, from one rooftop to another. Her wings made sounds like Phad... Phad… Phad... and she never seemed to mind because she had faith in her own capacities gifted by God… on her powerful wings!

                The pigeon lived in her nest made on Noore Allah Masjid, made with straws & threads collected from St. Mary’s Church near the Gurudwara.

                The pigeon flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir, and then she flew right back again. Birds have no religions, then why we humans?

                One sad day, when the pigeon flew out, it started to rain. Although she flew with all her might, she couldn’t get home again. She beat her wings against the rain, but they got wet and slowly some feathers drooped from her wings, and shewas injured due to this.

                The pigeon tried her best to fly. But she knew that she was “pooped.”

                A kind 7-year-old girl, Krishna, was watching that troubled pigeon. Krishna was enjoying a bath in the rain that time.

                Krishna saw the poor pigeon fall into her garden. Krishna felt that in that situation her duty was quite simple. She took that tiny frail bird and kept her warm and dry. She gave her water so she could drink, some food to eat and told her, “Not to cry... you will be o.k. soon Mashkalli!”

                Krishna named the pigeon “Mashkalli” because of Mashkalli’s beautiful white colour and eyes like diamonds. Krishna told Mashkalli, “You look like a “Shantidoot… Messenger of Peace & love!”

                Krishna cared for Mashkalli for fifteen days, until Mashkalli became quite strong. Krishna took Mashkalli everywhere she went, to school, to work, and to play. They grew very close during this period.

                One day Krishna watched Mashkalli fearfully. Krishna knew Mashkalli wouldn’t be there long.

                “Please, mummy, may I keep this bird Mashkalli? Now Mashkalli loves me and I love her. We are friends; I just can’t let him go.” Krishna’s voice was sad and low when she requested her mother.

                Krishna’s mother spoke softly and gently. She knew just what to say, “Look Krishna! Mashkalli’s home is somewhere else. Mashkalli’ must soon fly away... our garden has been a resting place for her, just like a small hotel or hospital. Krishna, it is nice of you that you took care of your bird friend Mashkalli. In her troubled time. However, this does not mean that you can keep her in any cage. If you really love someone, let us free them! If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly come back to you someday…!”

                Yes, what Krishna’s mother said was very true. It happened the next day. Mashkalli circled overhead, and then she flew away, as Krishna watched.

                Krishna felt a little sad for a few days because she was missing Mashkalli a lot. However, Krishna had full faith in her mother’s words. “If you really love someone you have to free them. If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly comeback to you someday…!”

                Now Mashkalli was rather home again. She was feeling very happy. Mashkalli again started to flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir.

                Now, “The Messenger of Peace & love: Shantidoot Mashkalli” takes a little longer flight. Mashkalli always stops at Krishna’s garden to tell her friend hello, pay thanks, and play with her every morning.

                If this, an uneducated bird can pay thanks to her helper, why not we, so called educated humans…?”

                In the rising sun’s light of hope, little Krishna was thinking this, and Shantidoot Mashkalli was eating food from Krishna’s little, soft palm, sitting on her hand. Krishna’s mother was watching that special friendship of an innocent human and an innocent bird. She smiled.

                A man woke up in the middle of a dirt road. Half of his face had brown dirt covering it, and his hair was a mess. His shirt was ragged, and he had lost a shoe. His vision was all blurry, and he was squinting in the sunlight, struggling to make use of his eyes. He could see a few hazy trees in the distance, beyond the expanse of dry, yellow land and grass. He had been in an accident. He had fallen from his buggy, banged his head, and had forgotten everything about himself. He had woken up with absolutely no memory of anything whatsoever. He knew he should have some memories, but he could locate none. He became very afraid. Who was he? How had he got here?

                As his vision continued to adjust to his surroundings, he saw a pile of papers on the ground, and a little red booklet resting on the top of them, just a few meters from where he was. He had not noticed, however, that a few meters to the left of this pile of information, was a lion.

                The lion walked gently in front of the papers, creating a barrier between them and the man. Then the lion sat down on his hindquarters, and looked at the man in the eyes.

                The man did not move. He was well aware that it was a lion now.

                "I saw what happened," said the lion, seeing that the man had no idea.

                "You were driving too fast in that thing," the lion nodded towards the buggy further down the dirt road, which was tipped over on its side. "And you fell out. These papers have all your information on them, your name, address – all of your details."

                The man felt like he was frozen to the warm earth beneath him.

                "Oh, and don't worry," added the lion, forgetting how things may have appeared to the man "...I'm not particularly hungry."

                "May I have the papers?" asked the man, wishing to get away with his details as quickly as possible.

                "Yes, of course," said the lion, standing up and ready to remove the blockade he had created.

                "Oh, thank you," said the man, relieved, "I don’t even remember who I am!"

                At this the lion stopped. He sat back down. This was too good to spoil. A man who had no ideas about himself? No psychological baggage at all? No identity to speak of? Oh, how wonderful...

                "Ah, amnesia of the self," said the lion, feeling refreshed. "Beautiful."

                "What do you mean beautiful?" asked the man impatiently, "I need my identity back! I mean...who am I? I know nothing of my past, not even my own name! Please!" he begged, "The papers!"

                "Listen to yourself panicking like this," the lion chuckled. "This is quite silly."

                "But I have absolutely no identity!" cried out the man, pleading for this lion to give him some information about himself.

                "I will give you these papers," said the lion, "but I want you to look at something. At the moment you know nothing about yourself, but you do not deny your own existence. You are begging me to give you your name and personal history, because without these stories you feel you are nothing, no one – that you don’t exist without your identity. But you are still here. Do not confuse your name, history and occupation with who you are. You exist, no matter what your story, what your name. If you were not so desperate for labels and definitions to create an identity for yourself, you would feel so free, so happy, so at one with this creation. Can you not just be comfortable having no definitions for a moment, and really be aware of what you truly are?

                "This is a blessing in disguise,” added the lion.

                This man felt he could not argue with the lion anymore, so he followed his orders. Who was he? This was what he was trying to find out through the information on those papers. But the lion was right, at the moment this man had no ideas about himself, yet somehow, his existence was being fully felt. His existence was present, but now it was no longer connected to any ideas. His existence was not limited to any particular form, it was everywhere, making up everything.

                The lion was now standing, looking at the man, with dark, deep eyes. As the man looked back at the lion, he felt like whatever was looking out of the lion's eyes, was not separate from what was looking out of his own.

                "Now you can have the papers." The lion pushed them with its paw towards the man, and they made a scraping noise on the ground. The man crouched down, picked them up, but now was not so eager to give himself a description. He figured these papers would be useful so he could find his house, get his bearings, but he didn’t need them to know who he was just yet. He placed them in his back pocket, and skipped off towards the hut he could now see in the distance, completely free of the ideas about himself he previously had.

                There abode in Thessaly, in the days of Hercules, a strange race of men who had the head and arms of a man together with the body of a horse. They were called Centaurs, or Bull-Slayers.

                One of them named Cheiron, famous for his knowledge of medicine, music and botany, had been the teacher of Hercules. But many of them, although learned, were not good. Hercules and Theseus had waged war on them and had killed many, so that their numbers were greatly lessened.

                Having married Deianira, the daughter of a powerful King of Calydon, in Greece, Hercules was traveling home with her when he came to the banks of a river and was at a loss how to cross it. Seeing his perplexity, Nessus, one of the Centaurs, offered to take Deianira on his back and carry her over the stream. This offer Hercules gladly accepted.

                No sooner, however, did the crafty Centaur obtain possession of Deianira than he made off with her, intending to have her as his own wife. You can easily imagine how angry this outrage made Hercules. He shot one of his poisoned arrows with so much force that it went right through the traitor Centaur, and wounded him even unto death.

                But, before dying, Nessus had time to tell Deianira that if she wanted to keep Hercules always true to her she had but to take his shirt, and, when her husband's love was waning, prevail on him to wear it.

                Deianira took the shirt, and shortly afterwards, being afraid that her husband was ceasing to love her, she sent it to him as a present.

                Now, you will remember that Hercules had shot through the shirt of Nessus one of his poisoned arrows, and you will not be surprised to hear that some of the poison had remained in the shirt. So when Hercules put it on, which he did immediately upon receiving it, he was seized with frenzy and, in his madness, he uttered terrible cries and did dreadful deeds.

                With his powerful hands he broke off huge pieces of rock, tore up pine-trees by their roots and hurled them with resounding din into the valley.

                He could not take off the fatal shirt, and as he tore off portions of it he tore, at the same time, his quivering flesh.

                The servant of Deianira who had carried him the fatal shirt, and who wished to solace him in his pain, he seized as she approached him and flung headlong into the sea, where she was changed into a rock that long, so runs the legend, kept its human form.

                But at ln the majesty and the courage of the hero asserted themselves, and, although still in agony, his madness left him.

                Calling to his side his friend Philoctetes, he wished to embrace him once more before dying; but fearful lest he should, in so doing, infect his friend with the deadly poison that was consuming him, he cried in his agony: "Alas, I am not even permitted to embrace thee!"

                Then he gathered together the trees he had uprooted and made a huge funeral pyre, such as was used by the ancients in burning their dead. Climbing to the top of the heap, he spread out the skin of the Nemean lion, and, supporting himself upon his club, gave the signal for Philoctetes to kindle the fire that was to reduce him to ashes.

                In return for this service he gave Philoctetes a quiver full of those deadly arrows that had been dipped in the blood of the Hydra of Lerna.

                He further enjoined his friend to let no man know of his departure from life, to the intent that the fear of his approach might prevent fresh monsters and new robbers from ravaging the earth.

                Thus died Hercules, and after his death he was received as a god amongst the Immortals on Mount Olympus, where he married Hebe, Jove's cupbearer. In his honor mortals were commanded to build altars and to raise temples.

                The county recreation center swimming pool where one gets such badges presents very different conditions to those created when a June storm dumped six inches of rain over Columbia in Missouri with little warning—causing floodwaters from creeks to burst their banks, causing overflow zones to turn into ponds.

                When 15-year-old Dominic Viet and 16-year-old Joseph Diener passed a basketball court that had turned essentially into a water polo area, they heard the frantic shouting of a young woman desperately trying to keep her head above water under the force of a current.

                The boys had seen the girl swimming with a friend there before, but it was now obvious she was drowning.

                “The first thing that came into my mind was to get into the water,” Dominic told CNN. “We didn’t have time to think, her head was barely above the water and we could see her sinking more down every second. We didn’t think about the risks, we had to get her out.”

                Heroes will do as heroes do, and hoisting her up onto their shoulders, Dom and Joseph got her ashore, where emergency services arriving at someone else’s call performed first aid and rushed her to the hospital.

                Floodwaters are no conditions to be swimming in. There can be sewage runoff, loose chemicals, downed power lines charging the current with electricity, or physical debris such as manhole covers that have been lifted out of their sockets by the force of the water.

                Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Jenkins described the boys’ act as heroic and brave, as did Dominic’s mom, who had been calling her son for some time before and was growing nervous.

                She sent her husband, Dom’s father, to check on his position, but when he arrived he saw ambulances and firetrucks from the call that was meant to rescue the young woman.

                “I thought of the worst, he’s on a bike and people weren’t paying attention and my fear was he was going to pull up and see our son on the ground,” said Mrs. Viet. “But then he saw them on their bikes heading back to their friend’s house, and I got a text from Dominic saying ‘Coming home soon, just saved a woman’s life Mom.'”

                Oh Mom… how about you have a little faith?

                The fire department will honor the two boys with a “Citizen Life Safety Award” next week.

                Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant acted with bravery that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest honor.

                On Friday, Ralph Puckett, Jr. was hosted at the White House where he received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. government’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.

                Ralph’s first response was to ask, “Why all the fuss? Can’t they just mail it to me?”

                But, after his lifetime of service to the nation, President Joe Biden said at the medal ceremony, “Rather than mail it to you, I would’ve walked it to you.”

                Ralph’s wife of 68 years, Jeannie Puckett, was in the audience, too, as Biden described how the couple met—while the brave Army Ranger was recovering from his wounds.

                They were married two years to the day after the battle in November, 1950, for which he was honored this week with the following citation: “For acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the commander 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company…”

                51 of Puckett’s Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out in a daylight attack to take Hill 205, just 60 miles from the border with China, which drew mortar, machine gun, and small-arms fire against them. First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in their offensive.

                To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire.

                “Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position, with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” continued the citation.

                When the Rangers finally reached the top of the hill, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn’t nearly over.

                “During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett.”

                Even though Puckett’s Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one, five attacks by a battalion-strength enemy were repulsed.

                During the first wave, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support. Over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.

                “He repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole, to check the company’s perimeter and to distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers.”

                Extraordinary selflessness above and beyond the call
                When the enemy launched a sixth attack, two mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting “grievous wounds” in both his feet, his backside, his left arm and shoulder.

                “Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy.

                Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy-controlled hill.

                First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

                First Time a Foreign Leader Attended This Ceremony
                Biden said in his remarks, “Korea is sometimes called the “Forgotten War.” But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett’s command — they’ll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.”

                “And the people of the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the President of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before.”

                President Moon said, “I learned that I’m the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.

                “Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean War… Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea.”

                “From the ashes of the Korean War, we rose, we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea’s peace and freedom. And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.”

                Puckett’s military service did not end in the Korean War. He also served in the Vietnam War, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars, adding to his five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.

                Visionaries are often accused of being a little mad. Even by their wives. Such was the case of Laungi, a resident of India’s drought-blighted Gaya district in the eastern state of Bihar.

                Loungi Bhuiya had become increasingly distraught as more and more farmers—including four of his own sons—left Kolithwa for greener pastures. Taking a leaf from Don Quixote, Bhuiyan was determined not only to dream an impossible dream but to make that dream come true by single-handedly bringing water to his village in hopes of transforming the barren land into arable acreage.

                Inspired by the earlier exploits of “Mountain Man” Dashrath Manjh, who, with just a hammer and chisel, spent 22 years carving a road through the mountain near the village Gehlaur from 1960 to 1982, Bhuiya set out to dig an irrigation canal by hand to the closest water source in the Bangetha Hills.

                “I had heard about him and I thought if he can do it, why can’t I?” Bhuiya told Al Jazeera. “They all thought I was mad.”

                “He decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village,” Village leader Vishnupat Bhokta told the Tribune of India.

                “The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”

                Despite the teasing from his family and fellow villagers, the now 70-year-old Bhuiya toiled every day to make the four-foot-wide by three-foot-deep canal a reality. It took him nearly 30 years to accomplish his goal, but now everyone is benefitting from the fruits of his decades’ long labors.

                Bhuiya, whose reputation as a neighborhood eccentric has since been transformed into local hero, was recently rewarded for his efforts with a brand-new Mahindra tractor, which will be used to expand the canal.

                Of course, when Quixote creator Miguel de Cervantes wrote: “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical may be madness. To surrender dreams, this may be madness… Maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be,” he wasn’t referring to Bhuiya—but he just as well might have been.

I turned to Glenn and said, “Do you think she’s gonna jump?” He said, “Oh, boy, she’s falling as we speak."
                It’s about a four-story drop from where she fell, and — without thinking — I just put my arms out as she came toward me. Listen, I was in the Marines, and even though that was 40-some years ago, I still think like a Marine; fortunately, I still react like one once in a while. She leveled out flat as she hit my arms, and bounced off me and fell about four feet away. I fell to the ground, too, from the impact, and I blacked out for a minute. When I came to, Glenn was holding up fingers and saying, “How many do you see?” I was OK. The woman was alive but was in a coma for a while and had brain surgery.

It’s a bear!” I opened my front door, and there was a 275-pound polar bear sitting on its haunches with a woman in its mouth, waving her around like a rag doll. I thought to myself, I’ve got no weapon or anything. Then I saw my shovel sitting there and found myself going to get it. Once I picked it up, I thought, Well, am I going to do anything, or is that woman going to die? So down the steps I went. 
                When I got over there, I stepped up and hit the bear in the eye. I’d heard this is the best way to fight a bear. He let go of the woman, and she ran into my house. The bear reached out and grabbed ahold of me, and the mauling was on. He tore off my right ear, and I was waiting for him to bite me again. A neighbor fired a shotgun, but it didn’t do any good, so he jumped into his truck and gunned it toward us. I was on my belly on the ground, watching this vehicle speeding our way, and it stopped about two feet away before the bear let me go.

                I spent seven days in the hospital. They worked on me for four hours one day, to staple my wounds, and then for four hours the next day, putting my ear back on. So I came out of it pretty good.

                The crash woke me up. Just after midnight, on a very windy Sunday last October, I heard a very loud noise, and it was a large fir tree falling into my yard from the neighbor’s yard. It crushed a greenhouse and took down the tip of a power line as it landed. I’ve been in my house almost 50 years and know how much damage wind and trees can do, but as I was coming downstairs and glanced outside, I was horrified to see brilliant flames outside my window, way up over my head.

                I live alone­ — my husband died six years ago — and I thought, I have to call 911. But there was no time. I thought, This could go everywhere. It could burn the whole hill. I threw on something over my nightgown, raced outside, grabbed a hose and started spraying water as hard as I could. The wind had already spread the flames to a live oak and then to some blackberry vines on the edge of my driveway. It was really howling now, and I could feel the heat, but I just braced myself and kept on squirting.

                This must have gone on for five minutes, but it felt like an hour. An architect neighbor smelled smoke and ran over to help. Then the couple across the driveway came, and someone called the fire department. When the fire trucks arrived, they yelled at us to move back, but I couldn’t stop. I said, “We have to keep water on this fire.”

                I had no idea I had done anything special. People I never met were knocking on my front door the next day, saying, “You’re a hero. You saved the hill.” But I was just the first responder. I saw what I saw, and I took action.

                Thousands of people lost everything that night in other parts of California. We were fortunate to be spared. But I don’t think it was a miracle. The reality is, my children weren’t there and my husband wasn’t there, and if I wanted to stay in the home I loved, I would have to step up. So I did — but then got a lot of help.

                Once upon a time 10 years ago I had my 15th birthday. My mum woke me up this marvelous morning and told me I had a special delivery at the front door. I dressed myself and ran down the stairs in excitement. When I opened the front door to my surprise I found a big box in the middle of the door way. I jumped in joy and ran inside to see my aunties, uncles, brothers, cousins, grandparents and the rest of my family that were already awake.Everyone wanted me to open the box already but I waited till I put it on the table. Oh my goodness I was about to open it when I heard a noise coming from the box. IT WAS A KITTEN AND A PUPPY. I quickly opened it and found an adorable kitten who was all black with ginger and white patches on her. I named her Precious. Aw how cute was she. After that I carefully took my puppy out of the box and held him. He was a little tiny black and white dog with a few patches on him. I chose to name him terror because he tore the box open before I got him out. My family told me that I got my puppy Terror from my male relatives and I got the kitten Precious from my female relatives. The afternoon was here already and I had turned 15 at 12:13PM. My friends came over to celebrate my birthday. When they all got here to my surprise I had found a huge gift from all of them. I opened this card up and found airfares to Sydney and to go to Palm Beach to meet my inspirations, the cast of home and away. " OH MY GOODNESS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY EVER I CAN'T BELIEVE IT" We all went out and had an amazing time. That isn't all you get Jessica. " We are all going out tomorrow before you leave to Sydney with all of your family. "WHAT YOU MEAN I AM LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT WITH MY FAMILY TO GO ON AN AEROPLANE"? "YEP YOU GOT IT RIGHT GIRL". "SEE THIS IS LEGIT THE BEST DAY EVER"I exclaimed. "WE HAVE ALSO GOT YOU TICKETS TO MEET AND GREET ONE DIRECTION AND YOU WILL BE STAYING IN THE SAME HOTEL AS THEM". "WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "I LOVE YOU GIRLS SO MUCH YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME". "Well girly you and your family better start packing because you leave tomorrow night and we are all going out tomorrow to celebrate your 15th". "Alright"! Guess what Jessica. "What"? "That isn't it we haven't told you another surprise. "WHAT IS IT"? "WE ARE COMING TO Sydney ASWELL AS YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF. SO IS TERROR AND PRECIOUS"? "AHHHHHHHH ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "YEP WHY WOULDN'T WE BE"? "WHERE IS PRECIOUS AND TERROR GOING TO STAY"? "WITH YOU". "TERROR AND PRECIOUS ARE STAYING WITH YOU AND WE FLY OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON JETSTAR JQ1314 AT 9:00PM."WHEN WE GET TO SYDNEY EVERYONE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT AND EVERYTHING". The day came and I was super excited. at about 10:30PM we arrived at Sydney airport and it felt so good to be in my favorite place. I mean this was the best birthday ever that I will never ever ever ever forget in a whole life time. Jetstar was an amazing flight and we had the best time ever.

                Life is full of unexpected surprises. There are many opportunities when one can secretly wish for something exciting to happen – something out of the ordinary. The real surprise is when the wish unexpectedly comes true. I never believed that something like this could ever happen to me; such a thing that would make me stop and look back at the events in awe. I think you would agree that something as simple as being lost in the forest for less than ten minutes should have no influence on my life. If you do agree, that makes both of us wrong.

                Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Coote’s Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

                As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. That’s when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that can’t be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

                I think that another reason that I felt carefree was because my parents didn’t panic. They took the situation under control and headed for any open area in hopes to find a map (many of these maps were found throughout the grounds, telling you where you were). From my point of view, at the time, it seemed as if they were excited as I was about losing our way. In the end, it only took my parents ten minutes to find such a map and we were back on the trail in no time.

                An experience like this made me think about my place in life. I’m the type who loves seeking out adventures. When we were lost, I realized that I had everything I would ever need with me – my family. They’ve always supported me in everything I do. This experience made me realize that families need to stick together; you don’t realize how much you need them until, for a moment, you think they’ll be the last people you see for the rest of your life.

                It’s incredible how much a simple thing like being lost in a forest for ten minutes will affect your outlook on life. Things like not being able to find your way back to where you came from make you appreciate the little things in life. Looking back on the day, I realize now that it was fate. Moments like that are few and far between and should be taken as a lesson. Surprises like this were, and always will be, an unexpected gift for all.

                I was full of excitement and very queer to see the new born baby next door. My Mom told that our neighbour, Shanti Bhabhi had given birth to a little fairy, the lakshmi of the home, a baby girl. But suddenly this happiness curve on my face disappeared with the thought of her husband. Shanti's husband, Raju bhaiya who was not a good man. A drunkard by nature, he had never provided that space to his wife and his male chauvinism was fiercely aggressive. I once heard his words in the street to the little daughter of our neighbours that studying and playing doesn't suit girls. They are meant for bangles and making rotis, just like a common male chauvinist. The prevailing awareness of the maltreatment of girls in the media, shook me again. I just wished that this liitle fairy should not face such a treatment and should be brought up on an equality basis with the sons of the same house. But somewhere in the heart the thought took place so firmly that I went to Shanti Bhabhi's house and what I saw next was unbelievable. I saw Raju Bhaiya with his little daughter in his hands and saying that he wished to grew his daughter with all the best education that he can afford. The love and incredibility of the moment rolled down tears from my eyes. I got back to my home relaxing that really the little fairy has brought happiness and a positive change along with a pleasant surprise.

                After a long bout with Parkinson’s, my Grandmother had passed. And as a pleasant surprise, I was in the will. I had inherited her car, and the ghost that came in the car. That’s right. Grandma’s car was haunted. Her 1980 Chevy Citation was haunted.

                I was surprised in so many ways. Hell, when I first turned the key I didn’t think that the thing would even start, let alone be haunted. It was an aged hunk of junk, and hadn’t seen much use in the past twenty years. And then when I saw the little figure creeping along the dash, I started to wonder if this was why she chose to stop driving it; and not because of the glaucoma.

                I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find something that wasn’t static, when it came. It was tiny, the size of my hand. It was the classic ghost. Literally, the classic ghost. In a little white sheet (a handkerchief, really) with tiny holes where the eyes and mouth would be. I couldn’t see any feet beneath the hem of the shroud, but it seemed to have tiny little hands poking up as it levitated towards me. And as it came drifting along, it was making a little ethereal ‘whooooooo’ sound at me.

                It was freaking adorable.

                I mean, come on. It was like a kindergarten Halloween decoration had come to life and came to visit. It was so little! It was smaller than the rat I had when I was in college. It was smaller than my breakfast sandwich. I wanted to pet it.

                I suppose in retrospect, yeah. I should have been a little more respectful. Maybe taken it a little bit more seriously. Seeing visible proof of the afterlife, actual confirmation of existence after death… well, that’s serious stuff. And, one would think, deserved more respect than the delirious giggles I wasn’t holding back.

                I think even the little ghost was actually taken aback by this. It stopped mid-‘whoo’ and kind of stared at me. It just drifted in place, bobbing like a floater in the corner of your eye.

                And there I sat, snickering and crouched back against the driver’s side door of the old Citation. The car still smelled like Vicks and old menthol cigarettes, the defining scents of my dear old Grandma.

                Was this Grandpa, maybe? Could it be? My mind raced. Grandma never spoke much of her ex-husband, just that he was a son of a bitch and that he had gotten his ‘just desserts’. Did his ‘just desserts’ involve being murdered and cursed to haunt a handkerchief on his jilted wife’s dashboard? But then I remembered mom saying that her dad had just jumped ship and moved to Iowa, where he had died in 1979.

                So my theory was obviously sunk. I peered at the little thing, static from the dusty old radio an idle buzz in the back of my mind. The ghost just bobbed in the warm air beneath the windshield, occasionally emitting little ‘Whooo’s!’ at me. I didn’t think it was trying to scare me anymore.

                Then a much more troubling idea occurred to me. What if this thing was my grandmother? Oh, now that’s a terrible thought. I couldn’t think of a worse fate than being doomed to spend the rest of eternity haunting the interior of a mid-80’s compact.

                And worse, if this was my Grandma’s spirit then I’d feel especially guilty taking the Citation to the junkyard to sell for parts.

                I had to know. I sat in thought for a moment, then came to a resolution. I was going to see exactly who — or what — this thing really was. I sat up in the drivers seat, steeled myself. I reached out towards the little ghost with my fingers trembling.

                I won’t lie to you, I was terrified. At first I thought the whole thing was kind of funny, this little cutesy ghost the size of half a donut. But the prospect of what could be under that little white sheet, that scared the hell out of me. I didn’t want to see my undead Grandma, pale and shrunken and horribly shriveled after death. I wanted Grandma to be in heaven with Great-Uncle Al, and all of her dogs, and her one cat that I had liked.

                As I slowly reached out my shaking hand, it actually reached out to me a little bit. I was startled, and snatched my hand back a little bit. But I focused, and mentally pushed my hand forward again. I had to know.

                I yanked up the little white sheet with my eyes shut tight, and after a second I slowly eased them open so that I could see who — what — it was.

                I didn’t know the guy.

                I ended up making four hundred bucks at the junkyard. Which was another pleasant surprise

                I had got the money by work done at home, out of office hours. It came to four pounds altogether. At first I thought I would use it to discharge a part of our debt to Eliza’s mother. But it was very possible that she would send it back again, in which case the pence spent on the postal orders would be wasted, and I am not a man that wastes pennies. Also, it was not absolutely certain that she would send it back. I sent her a long letter instead–my long letters are almost her only intellectual pleasure. As for the four pounds, I reserved two for myself, for any incidental expenses, and decided to give two to Eliza. I did not mean simply to hand them to her, but to get up something in the way of a pleasant surprise.

                I had tried something of the kind before. Eliza once asked me for six shillings for a new tea-tray that she had seen. I went and stood behind her chair, and said, “No, dear, I couldn’t think of it,” at the same time dropping the six shillings down the back of her neck. Eliza said it was a pity I couldn’t give her six shillings for a tea-tray without compelling her to go up-stairs and undress at nine o’clock in the morning. It was not a success.

                However, I had more than one idea in my head. This time I thought I would first find out if there was anything she wanted.

                So on Sunday at tea-time I said, not as if I were meaning anything in particular, “Is there anything you want, Eliza?”

                “Yes,” she said; “I want a general who’ll go to bed at half-past nine and get up at half-past five. If they’d only do that, that’s all I ask.”

                “You will pardon me, Eliza,” I said, “but you are not speaking correctly. You said that was all that you asked. What you meant—-“

                “Do you know what I meant?”

                “I flatter myself that I know precisely—-“

                “Then if you know precisely what I meant, I must have spoken accurately.”

                But as we went to church I discovered that she wanted a new jacket. Her own was trimmed rabbit, and had been good, but the fur had gone bald in places.

                * * * * *

                Next morning I wrote on a sheet of note-paper, “To buy a new jacket. With your husband’s love.” I folded the two sovereigns up in this, and dropped the packet into the pocket of Eliza’s old jacket, as it hung in the wardrobe, not telling her what I had done. My idea was that she would put on the jacket to go out shopping in the morning, and putting her hand in the pocket, get a pleasant surprise. As I was leaving for town, she asked me why I kept on smiling so mysteriously. I replied, “Perhaps you, too, will smile before the day is over.”

                On my return I found Eliza at the front door. “Come and look,” she said, cheerfully. “I have got a pleasant surprise for you.” She flung open the drawing-room door, and pointed. In the middle of the table stood a spiraea, a most handsome and graceful plant. It stood in one of the best saucers, with some coloured paper round the pot, and the general effect was very good. I at once guessed that she had bought it for me with the change from my present to her, and thought it showed very good feeling in her.

                “I hope you have not given too much for this,” I said.

                “I didn’t give any money for it.”

                “I don’t understand.”

                “Well, you must know I had a present this morning.”

                “Of course I know.”

                “Did mother tell you? Yes, she has sent me a beautiful new jacket. Then a man came round with a barrow of plants, and he said he didn’t want money if I had any clothes to spare. So I gave him my old worn-out jacket for this spiraea, and—-“
                I remembered that I had seen the man with the barrow farther down the street.

                “Excuse me for one moment, Eliza,” I said, and dashed out after him.

                * * * * *

                He was a big, red-faced man, and he made no difficulty about it at all.

                “Yes,” he said, “I bought that jacket, gov’ner, and I don’t deny it. There it is at the bottom of my bundle, and I ain’t even looked at it since. Nor I ain’t goin’ to look now. You say there was two suvreigns in the pocket. A gent like you don’t want to swindle a common man like me. If you say the two suvreigns was there, then they’re there now, and I can return yer two pound out o’ my own, in a suttunty of gettin’ ’em back out o’ the jacket pocket. Bless yer! I knows an honest man when I sees one.”

                With these words he drew the money from his own waistcoat pocket, and handed it to me. I took it with some reluctance.

                “Hadn’t you better make quite certain—-“

                “Not a bit,” says he. “If them suvreigns were there when the jacket were ‘anded to me, they is there now. I could see as you was a man to be trusted, otherwise I’d ‘ave undone the bundle and searched long afore this.”

                * * * * *

                “What have you been doing?” said Eliza, on my return.

                “Never mind. Your mother has given you a new jacket. Let me have the pleasure of giving you a new hat.” I pressed the two coins into her palm.

                She looked at them, and said, “You can’t get a hat for a halfpenny, you know, dear. What did you rush out for just now? And why did you have these two farthings gilded? You’ll be mistaking them for sovereigns, if you’re not careful. Were you trying to take me in?”

                I did not quite see what to say for the moment, and so I took her suggestion. I explained that it was a joke.

                “You don’t look much as if you were joking.”

                “But I was. I suppose I ought to know if any man does. However, Eliza, if you want a new hat, anything up to half a sovereign, you’ve only to say it.”

                She said it, thanked me, and asked me to come and help her water the spiraea.

                “It’s such a shapely spiraea,” she said.

                “Yes,” I answered sadly, “it’s a regular plant.” And so it was, though I had not been intending what the French call a double entendre at the time

                “Surprises are beautiful because they come without waiting.” Not so true for Nancy though. She was sure her sister was planning a surprise for her birthday. Pulling open the pink pastel curtains of her bedroom window,  she hungrily drank in the fresh morning air. Her eyes were laced with longing. A soft smile slid across her lips which were otherwise dry with sadness and coated with grief.  Nancy was turning 30 today. “Keep calm. It’s only your 30th birthday”. Humming her favourite song in her head, her lips pursed in, Nancy ran her fingers over her thin wavy short hair. No a strand of grey! Many of her friends were already showing mini zebra stripes in their heads. But, not her! Thank goodness for that.

                She quickly glanced at the mirror and looked away. She never liked looking at the mirror. It always reminded her of what she was not. “Life is just a mirror and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you.” Wally “famous” Amos. Turning her face away from the mirror like it was an enemy on the prowl, a single glossy tear flowed down her cheek. Clutching the ends of her dress, she poured them back in again. She was not going to think of the past and all that it had done to her. She held her palms up and looked at them. Shrivelled walnuts were what they looked like. Lifeless, yet useful. “Nothing worth having, comes easy.”

                All these years she had worked at different factories, clothes, metals, chemicals, shoe, scrubbed the floors at big hotels where perfumed men and women floated easily.  Ever since their parents died, her only goal was to educate Kate, her younger sister. Her emotions came running back to the present. Quickly, she wiped her dried tears and rushed some chirpy cheer on her face. She paced to the door and back.

                “A sister is a little bit of childhood that can never be lost.” Kate was her dream, her hope, her happiness. The gleam of a thousand stars shone on her face as she thought of her sister. Her precious possession. She meant everything to her. She was all she had. Kate shined liked a diamond in a heap of coal. She was an outstanding student and an obedient younger sister. And today, Nancy was sure Kate would surprise her like she did every year. Nancy’s nostrils swelled open in anticipation of the sweet aroma of the freshly baked chocolate cake that would welcome her. Her tongue was eager to lick up the soft, brown cream and her teeth were ready to bite into Kate’s inviting delicacy. She stretched her ears with her hands to hear the sound of Kate’s footsteps coming towards her. She clapped her hands and giggled at her own act of childishness.
                She waited and waited.

                It seemed like an endless wait and a tide of emotions were rushing through Nancy. Finally, she heard her younger sister approaching her room. Her eyes lit up, her steps turned into a spring and her heart grew all  bouncy. She sniffed the air to catch a whiff of the chocolate cake but it was missing. Maybe it was not chocolate flavour this time, she imagined with pride intruding her thoughts. Her sister was all grown up now. She could surprise her with something else.

                Kate walked into her room empty handed. No cake, no flowers, no package wrapped in shiny golden paper, tied with red ribbons. The excitement dissolved from Nancy’s face. Her face looked like a blank, crumpled, white page. Kate was smiling. She could win the world with the radiance of her smile. She gave her sister a tight hug. “Happy birthday” said Kate. Nancy loosened herself from the warm embrace and looked at her sister. “Thank you” she said, smiling coldly. “And here’s your gift” Kate handed her a brown envelope. Nancy’s eyebrows shot up like mountain peaks and her eyes were flooded with questions.

                “Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love is by far the truest type of love. This is your admission letter to the community college. I want you to pick up from where you left.”

                Nancy’s eyes grew moist and her trembling hands were silenced by Kate’s firm grip over them. Nancy shut her eyes tight and let her tears flow as she folded her hands in prayer. Kate’s words sparkled with happiness and shined with guilt as she said “You deserve much more my dear sister, but this is all I can give you.”

I visualised and wished that I would get some big surprise as a birthday gift from the Universe and then I completely forgot about it. But just 15 days before my birthday I was diagnosed with Typhoid. On the day of my birthday I was very weak, bedridden and taking my pills and eating only boiled food. I was unable to talk over the phone so no one called me and my family thought it was not appropriate to bring me cake as I was unable to eat it. It was my birthday evening and I was at home feeling dull.

                The Universe never forgets your wish, and it did not forget mine either, so then it happened. All my friends came over to my place and gave me a big birthday surprise! They brought the cake and a gift which was a branded Jacket, which was also one of my wishes. I had an awesome time with them and felt so happy.

                Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no questions....just a black dot in the center of the page. The professor seeing the expression on everyone's face, told them the following: "I want you to write what you see there."

At the end of the class, the professor took all the answer papers and started reading each one of them aloud in front of all the students. All of them with no exceptions, described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet, etc. etc. etc.

No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.
                
                Our life is a gift given to us by God, with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature renewing itself everyday, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see everyday.
                
                However we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on.
                
                The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life.

                surprise party she was planning for her husband. She had
                been meticulously preparing for this event, designing every aspect
                of the party from the invitations to the food, and she was very excited
                about it.
                Family members whom Guermo hadn’t seen in years were flying in from Peru in
                a few days. Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
                from various places across the country. The caterer and band were set.
                The best part for Liz: she knew Guermo did not have a clue about the party. She
                could not wait to see the look on his face when he walked into a big “Surprise!” in
                his own home.
                The party was to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about picking
                relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to their hotel, Guermo
                walked into the kitchen and said, quite certainly, “Sweetheart, I don’t want
                anything special done for my birthday.”
                “What do you mean?” Liz responded nonchalantly, though her heart began to
                pound.
                “I mean that I don’t want a surprise party.”
                “Okay,” Liz said with a shrug. “Not a problem.”
                Liz’s mind raced. There was nothing she could do about Guermo’s request now.
                And, frankly, she didn’t want to. Liz had been planning this for more than a year.
                The party would go off as she intended. She did not want all of her effort to be for
                naught.
                When Guermo came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends,
                he was shocked. Tears filled his eyes. (This response was something Liz had not
                predicted.) Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in nearly 20
                years and family members who had come from Peru just for this evening.
                But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry with his wife. He
                felt ambushed. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like people to
                see him that way. That was why he did not like being surprised.
                Salsa music filled the home of Liz and Guermo. Guests filled up on ceviche, lomo
                soltado and empanadas. Liz whispered “I love you” in Guermo’s ear, they shared
                a kiss, and the two danced the night away.

                Once upon a time a plump old woman name Tante Adela lived in French Canada.  She lived all alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

                One morning she got up very early as it baking day and there was much to do.  She took a load of wood outside to her oven. 

                “Now why would oven door be open?” she said.  She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in.  But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

                The old woman bent over to look in.  When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut. She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

                When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

                At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw the neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

                “Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick!  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Felix.  “Maybe it is your cat.”

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

                “I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

                Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road.  She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross.  After all, three heads are better than two.

                “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down its back?”

                “Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath.  “Come right away!  There is a skunk in my oven.”

                “A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

                “Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela.  “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

                “You have a point,” said Louis Ross.  “I will come over as soon as I have finished feeding the chickens.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out.  “You must come to my farm.  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                “Are you sure?” said Samuel.  “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

                The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                “Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela.  “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snark?  I don’t think so!”

                “I will come right over,” said Samuel.  “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

                So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help.  By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there.  Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

                “Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

                “I know that!” said Tante Adela.  “The question is, what to do about it?”

                “I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “She will not be able to bake bread in there for a month!” said Madame Roy, and everyone agreed.

                “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                “And it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel.  He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

                “What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross.  “A dog will bark.  Maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

                “If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

                “What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” said someone else.  “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                So this plan was dropped.  No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers.

                “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                “Oh, woe is me!” wailed Tante Adela. 

                By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk.  And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come.  Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows.  Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn.  And one by one, everyone found a reason to head home.

                At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard.  The young man may be simple-minded, she thought.  Still, who else could she turn to for help?

                “Jules!” she said.  “Jules Martel.  There is a skunk in my oven.  Can you get him out without scaring him?”
                stop
                What would you do to try and get the skunk out of the oven?

                Jules nodded his head.  He walked over to the oven.  He opened the door and leaned inside.  He spoke in a low voice.  No one could tell what he was saying.  At last he stepped back.  Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway.  Everyone stepped back a few feet.  The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground.

                Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high.  And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “How did you get him to come out?” said Samuel to Jules.

                Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                “What DID you say to it?” said someone else.

                “I just told him,” said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, “that if he stayed in the oven any more, he would begin to smell like Tante Adela’s bread.  And if that happened, none of the other skunks would come near him.”

                “Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “That a low creature like a skunk cares about what others creatures like him think of him.”

                “I suppose all creatures must have some sense of self-respect,” said Alice Roy, “no matter who they are.”  Alice Roy and the others nodded in silence

                In just three days, it will be Christmas. Despite the bright and cheery decorations twinkling in the streets, wreaths on doors, and Christmas trees peeking through windows, Hector doesn't feel one drop of joy or excitement. The magic of Christmas seems to have evaporated this year. People passing one another on the street do not wish each other Happy Holidays, smile, or even make eye contact. They simply rush by with their heads down and eyes straight ahead, their minds preoccupied with their to-do lists and avoiding human interaction. 

                Hector doesn't even feel Christmas Spirit from his own family. This morning, he woke up excited to decorate the family Christmas tree with his mother as they did every year. They had barely started wrapping the lights when the phone rang. "Oh dear, it's Aunt Susan!" Hector's mother exclaimed. "Go on without me. I’ll be back." Hector finished the whole tree by himself by the time his mother was off of the phone with her sister. Later that afternoon, Hector's father cancelled their plans to play basketball together. Even Hector's older brother, Yohan, was too busy playing video games to help Hector make shortbread cookies for the family. 

                Feeling discouraged by the lack of festivity around the village and his home, Hector snuggles up with his most comfortable blanket and lets out an enormous sigh. He turns off the light and falls asleep. 

                That night Hector's Native American grandmother, Tallulah, pays him a visit in his dream. Around eight months ago, she left Hector's family to join the great white falcon in the sky. In her gentle voice, she whispers: “Hector, it's up to you to reinvent the magic of Christmas. You can change things. Search in your heart and you’ll find the solution.”

                When he wakes up, Hector cannot stop thinking about his dream. “Reinvent the magic of Christmas,” Tallulah said. He thinks about her words and jots down ideas on a sheet of paper, but crosses them out one by one. Suddenly, his face lights up.

                After lunch, Hector hangs a “do not disturb” sign on the door of his bedroom, closes the curtains, and sits down in his laboratory. This little corner of his room is equipped with a big lamp, magnifying glass, and all the materials from the chemistry set his parents got him for his birthday.

                All afternoon, Hector experiments with various combinations of Christmas ingredients. He melts candy canes and spices into little bowls, then mixes them with some of the plant oils that his grandmother Tallulah handed down to him. The liquid smells pepper-minty and delicious, and Hector feels a rush of optimism. Perhaps this is it! He takes the bowl in his hand and offers a sniff to Zephir, his big striped cat. Zephir's first sniff sends him into a spiral of sneezes. He sniffs the potion once more, then lies down on his back with his feet directly in the air. Hmmmm. Must need some work, thinks Hector. He adjusts the quantities, replaces some of the peppermint with other Christmas ingredients. He looks at Zephir and lets out a joyful shout. 

                Licorice, chocolate chips, cinnamon, star anise powder, three drops of Ayahuasca, a drop of the small seed of Nahele, and two drops of moonflower. He discovered the Christmas Spirit elixir formula!

                Using colored paper from his mother’s desk, Hector cuts, folds, and glues. He makes thirty red, green, blue, yellow, and purple envelopes into which he carefully applies two drops of Christmas Spirit elixir. On each card, he places a sticker of a little elf with a sentence written in capital letters.

                The next day after lunch, Hector gets on his bike. Along each street in the village, he slips a colored envelope under the door of the first house on both the left and right side of every street. Once he finishes all his rounds, Hector returns home. He sits down on his bed and waits. When it's 5 o’clock, he tip-toes downstairs, checks to make sure that no one is looking, then quietly opens the front door and slips outside. Then Hector then walks back into the house, pretending to have just returned home and discovered the little red letter. “Mom, Dad, Yohan, come quick!” He calls. 

                When all four of them are standing together in the living room, Hector reads the label aloud. “Open this letter as a family. After opening me, you should close me again and slip me under the door of the neighbor to your right.”

                The family bubbles with curiosity. Hector's mother grabs the envelope and opens it. A strong scent of chocolate, spice, and incense floats across the living room. Hector's parents and brother stand completely still as the delicious scent surrounds them. Suddenly they begin to move, their eyes sparkling, large smiles slowing spreading across their faces. Hector's father begins to dance, grabbing Hector's mother's hand and twirling her to music only they can hear. They both hum and looking lovingly into one another's eyes. Yohan grabs Hector and lifts him above his head, then begins to spin him around as he used to do when Hector was little. 

                “How about we take the scooters to go look at some Christmas decorations around town?” Hector's mother blurts out, smiling from ear to ear. 

                The family bundles themselves in hats and scarves and coats and rush outside. His brother takes the red scooter, and his father the blue one.

                “Come on, princess, get into my carriage.” Hector's father says to Hector's mother. 

                “Wait!” his mother says. She runs back into the house and grabs the red envelope. When she comes out into the cold again, her husband and two sons are circling around on their scooters. 

                Hector's mother runs across the lawn and stuffs the letter underneath the neighbor's door. She rings doorbell three times and shouts, “Merry Christmas!”

                Then all four of them speed down the street, Hector holding on to his big brother's waist and Hector's mother holding onto Hector's father. Both scooters slide over a large patch of ice, then shoot quickly into a pile of snow. Hector's parents roar with laughter. Hector holds his brother tight.

                Everywhere they go, the village is topsy-turvy. Hector chuckles to himself. His elixir is working! Mrs. Gari and Mrs. Dubois have finally stopped arguing and are building a snowman together, their cheeks rosy with laughter.  The mailman has switched out his black coat for a bright red one. His mailbag filled with candy, and he shouts "Merry Christmas!" as he slings sweet treats out to everyone he passes. On Lilas Street, the family joins an enormous snowball fight. Grown-ups and children alike launch snowballs at one another. Everyone is dodging, jumping, laughing and rolling. On Cerfs Street, a group is playing hide-and-seek among the piles of snow they were once preoccupied with removing from their walkways. Others are sledding, and others are blowing up balloons and releasing them into the chilly afternoon air. Delicious aromas of hot chestnuts, crepes, and nougat float throughout the village. At the large church down the hill, the carousel is all lit up and spinning around. Mostly adults are on it and bob up and down to the happy sound of the music. Hector's father and mother rush over to the merry-go-round. Hector spots his teacher on the ride, sitting in a big fire truck. Hector waves to him with a huge smile.

                His brother walks towards him holding two huge servings of cotton candy. They both sit down on the bench across from the dazzling Christmas tree. While enjoying his treat, Hector smiles. In all the eyes that meet his, there is that little spark that shines, a little spark of happiness that tastes like childhood. “Thank you, Tallulah,” he whispers quietly.

                Today is Ruby’s eighth birthday. Ruby does not know that her parents have arranged a circus party at her grandparents' house. Many of Ruby’s friends are invited to the party. Her little brother John helped his mum make the cake and the cupcakes.

                When Ruby woke up, she yawned. “It’s my birthday today,” she said. She ran down from her room into the kitchen. When Ruby’s mum heard her she hid the cake and the cupcakes. “Happy Birthday Ruby, we are going to take you to a surprise outing today.” “Yes!” Ruby cried, she was so excited.

                Ruby ran to her room and put on her gold sparkly dress, her gold sparkly shoes and a gold headband. She wore her favourite butterfly necklace. It was then time to go.

                Ruby hopped into the car and was amazed as there were balloons and streamers, and her seat was decorated in gold sparkles like a throne. Ruby wondered where her mum, dad and brother were taking her. As she looked outside the window she saw a beautiful rainbow in the bright blue sky, twinkling through the branches. “Hang on a minute,” Ruby said when the car stopped. "We are at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.” Grandma and Grandpa greeted Ruby outside the house. “Happy Birthday Ruby, please come inside,” they said.

                As Ruby walked inside the house she saw steamers and balloons everywhere. Ruby then walked into the backyard and was startled when she saw a big red tent with blue and yellow spots. “What is that? Oh my goodness, it’s a circus,” she cried. She walked into the tent and gasped as she saw many of her school friends. She saw Abigail, Amelia, Ella, Zara, Holly, Hannah, Abby, Elie, Cameron, Monique, Amy, Stephanie, Olivia, Maddison, Brianna, Isabella and her bestfriend Grace. They were all so excited to see Ruby.

                Ruby and her friends ran outside and started playing with her grandparents' dog, Rusty. Rusty was a nice puppy dog that didn’t bite anyone but loved to bite the red striped socks on the washing line.

                The big Jacaranda tree was decorated with sparkly streamers. Under the tree there was a picnic blanket set up with a plate of sandwiches for her and her friends. They all sat together and enjoyed their lunch. Once they finished they heard Grandma call out, “Its time for the circus.” They ran into the tent.

                Inside the tent they saw Grandma dressed as an Acrobat and Grandpa was dressed like a Ringmaster. They started to giggle. A man then walked into the tent with two ponies. Grandpa and the man helped all the children have turns riding on the ponies. After everyone had a turn on the pony, a lady walked in with a big trapeze. The lady helped Grandma swing on the trapeze. Everybody cheered and clapped for Grandma. Then everyone had a turn on the trapeze. They were having a wonderful time.

                When it was time to cut the cake, they all went outside where they saw a big pink circus cake set up on a table under the sparkly tree. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to Ruby. They all had a piece of cake and cupcakes with ice-cream.

                When everyone had left, Ruby ran up to her mum, dad, brother, grandma and grandpa and told them that it was the best birthday she had every had and gave them lots of hugs and kisses.

            story2="""About six months ago, the supervisor of one of my teams left. Since all my other managers were very busy, I stepped in to oversee the team operationally. I was rather rusty and there were many challenges in the team that we needed to conquer and I was a bit overwhelmed. But more about that another one.

                Lisa was a relatively new team member. She was the quiet one in team meetings, slow in adapting to changes and somewhat lacking confidence in her abilities. Due to the changes in the team, I really needed her to step up and expand the scope of her activities. I started to progressively give her new tasks so as not to overwhelm her. However, she kept showing silent or sometimes not so silent resistance to any new activity type, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated.

                After one particularly aggravating incident when she called in sick 30 min after I gave her a new task, I knew we could no longer continue this way. I was planning to have a very tough talk with her and tell her off.

                Fortunately, just then, the Harvard Business Review’s “Why leading with compassion is a better managerial tactic than toughness” article came to me in one of a multitude of serendipitous moments that are sprinkled through my life. It reminded me of something that I already knew well but had for a moment, forgotten in my anger – compassion in leadership promotes employee trust and loyalty.

                With my regained balance, I called her and we started talking. It was still a difficult conversation centered around two areas – what are the reasons for her resistance and what she wants to achieve in our team. Lisa shared that she was a perfectionist and had a strong fear of not completing her tasks as per my expectations and the training she received for her new activities was not sufficient to make her feel confident. She also complained that her current workload does not allow her to take on anything new (which was partially true). She had big ambitions for professional growth, but she did not seem to make the connection that to achieve them, she would need to keep expanding her responsibilities and learning new things. I directed the conversation there and clearly told her that she could not expect growth within my team unless she steps up. It was a stern message to deliver, and I am sure – a difficult one to hear.

                After the conversation, I arranged additional training for her and redistributed some of her work, but honestly, I was not sure she would make it. She had to overcome a deeply instilled fear of failure, and I could not predict whether she would manage.

                Time passed, their new supervisor joined and I stepped back. I could not observe Lisa’s progress very closely anymore, but I noticed that she is taking on more and more responsibilities. I was hesitant to broach the subject with her because I was afraid I would jinx her headway.

                Until a couple of weeks ago, when we had our regular skip-level meeting and she started the conversation with, “Marta, I have been waiting for this conversation. I wanted to tell you that I am not afraid of new things anymore. I realized that the only way you develop is by learning new things. And now when there is a new task, I just go, “bring it on.””

                Let me tell you – I did not stop smiling for three days after that. Fear of failure is one of the most crippling emotions one can experience. And I should know – I have been battling it all my life. But Lisa had managed to shift her focus to her desire for success instead and to keep moving forward. I see a bright future for her in our team.

                Vulnerability is risky on many levels. And it does not help that as managers, we are often taught that vulnerability is a sign of weakness and can damage our professional reputation. Melinda was brought up as a leader in precisely that way. She thought she should focus all work interactions entirely on operational tasks, issues and resolutions. While she gladly accepts others’ vulnerability and is very attuned to their emotions, sharing her own goes against her professional image of herself.

                This approach has brought her excellent results and much success. Still, over time she started realizing that she is not getting everything she needed from her relationships with her manager, her team and her colleagues. She often felt misunderstood and increasingly unhappy.

                Progressively, despite her conditioning to always seem in control and never talk about her own emotions and needs, she started realizing that she would never achieve full job satisfaction unless she opened up. And since this required a great leap of courage, she did it in one big move – in the course of one week, she had meetings with her manager, her team and some of her stakeholders. During those meetings, she, for the first time, managed to express her own feelings and intimate thoughts about her work relationships and her job. She talked about the issues she struggled with and showed up as a human being and not just a manager and professional.

                Since this is not a fairy tale, I cannot lie that everything magically changed after those meetings and now all those relationships are perfect and completely satisfactory for her. But she did open doors for conversations that would never be possible before, and that could eventually lead her to a place of comfort and trust.

                Now, I am often annoyed at people who quote their children and find some profound and deep meaning in everything the kid does or says. But my son is special and very wise (ask anyone who knows him).

                Three years ago, he and his friends encountered an aggressive dog and overnight, he was utterly terrified of anything with a tail. He would cross the street if he would see even a puppy approaching and if a dog got near him, he would scream and jump a mile high.

                This went on for a few months and then Benton appeared. Benton was a small white dog with a brown tail and was my son’s first imaginary friend (he read this and said that Benton was brown with a white rump, but that is not how I remember it). Later he had others too – a cat, a horse, a tiger, an invisible boy. At some point, they went up to eight and it was pretty crowded at home. But Benton was the first one and stayed with us the longest. My son was able to explain what the dog was currently doing at any given moment, and we talked about him often. We even wrote one and a half books about him (I got lazy after that).

                Over time, when we met a dog, after the initial scream, he would look at it and start finding similarities with Benton and show more and more interest in dogs. Two years after Benton came into our lives, my son was able to spend time with dogs and even play with them occasionally. He is still not their biggest fan (we are cat people in our house), but he feels quite comfortable with our friends’ very real dog who lives in our shared yard.

                There is a technique widely used in cognitive therapy called desensitization. It involves controlled exposure to anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus, starting with low intensity and increasing it gradually. I had tried to do that with real dogs, but apparently, no matter how slowly I thought I was moving, it was still too much for him. So he decided to start his desensitization himself with something he can bear – an imaginary dog.

                See, I told you he was wise.

                Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.

                One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.

                "A great many times, Marina," answered her Aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment".

                Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?

                "I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened".
                "It's true!" said Marina, intrigued, "Can you tell me that secret?"
                "Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear".

                Marina accepted, but she was rather worried. She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this. When her parents took her to bed, she herself put out the light. After a little while, she felt afraid of one of the shadows in the bedroom. Following the advice of Aunt Valerie, she closed the eyes of her face and opened the eyes of her hands. And, summoning up all her courage, she went over to touch that mysterious shadow...

                You have just one more chance to prove you can do it”, the words of my instructor echoed and reechoed in my ears as I got into the plane. Fear was a natural thing, I had heard and I had a common fear which a lot of others had: I was afraid of heights. I had been afraid of even looking down from a high building.

                This fear had been with me from as long as I could remember. It was to overcome my crippling fear of heights that I had decided to join the parachute school. I had gone through a vigorous routine to prepare myself for the big moment. Than at the signal to jump, I had shivered and trembled and started screaming in fear. The instructor had taken me by the hand and led me back into the plane. I was the only one that day who had taken off in the plane and landed-instead of jumping out of it in a parachute. As my companions met me at the base they smirked. I could see that even my good friends were uncomfortable in my presence. I was a failure.

                Then my instructor took me aside. He explained that it was not rare to be afraid. The real valor was in facing and overcoming the fear. I nodded and began to engage in self-talk. In the plane I was still doing this. I kept thinking how I was going to go home and face my parents if I did not get my wings. Then I tried to shutout the fear by imagining myself showing them my wings. The time for the jump grew near.

                The instructor placed his arm on my shoulder to reassure me that I could do it. I nodded and swallowed. My mouth felt dry as I felt the fear arising within me, shiver ran down my spines. I began mumbling affirmations again and then it was my turn. “Jump!” I heard the command and hesitated. “Jump!” shouted the instructor again. I thought no further and took the plunge fairly as I had been drilled.”Bravo” I heard my instructor’s voice in my ears. I fell swiftly and then looked up just in time to see the parachute canopy open above me. Then I looked down.

                As I looked at the beautiful scenario below me, tears glittered into my deep blue eyes, tears of pure joy. I had won. As I floated I remembered all my drills again and began to control my gliding. When I landed, my comrades were upon me laughing and shouting. I could see that they were as contented as I was that I had overcome the greatest enemy of man that is fear.

                Later my instructor landed and gave me a large grin.”I knew you could do it,” he said as he slapped my back, His face beamed with astonishment and mirth. I mumbled my thanks as a smile creased my face and then we ran to the truck with a tremendous feeling of elation.

                “When do we do it again, sir?” I asked the instructor. His reply was drowned in the shouting of my comrades.

                David had avoided flying on airplanes for most of his life because he found himself terrified of crashing. “I couldn’t stop thinking about all the disasters I heard about on the news, and every time I thought about flying, I would begin sweating and my heart started pounding. I only felt better by avoiding travel altogether.”

                But as time went on, David’s fear began to prevent him from doing things he wanted to do. He missed his niece’s graduation and an important work conference, and his fear prevented him from taking his family on the vacation to the coast. “After years of avoidance, I realized this fear was holding me back, and I had to do something about it.”

                David met with a therapist, who encouraged him to examine his thoughts about flying and to question their basis in reality. After some research, David had to admit that his fears about plane crashes were greatly exaggerated in his mind—the flight industry is extraordinarily safe, and accidents are rare. The therapist also taught David some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and visualization, that he could use any time he felt afraid.

                David decided to stop avoiding his fear, and he booked tickets to take his family on their dream vacation. As the flight took off, David focused on keeping his breathing calm and even. Whenever thoughts about crashing entered his mind, he replaced them with a positive thought about how much fun he would have with his family when they arrived. He closed his eyes and imagined the warm sand and waves lapping at his feet, his children laughing and building a sand castle. As the flight progressed, David began to relax. He even enjoyed looking out the window a bit. Anytime he felt himself getting nervous, he gently turned his attention back to his breathing until the feeling passed.

                When the wheels touched the ground, he felt something more powerful than relief: “I felt so proud that I had faced my biggest fear head-on. As we landed, I felt like this thing that had such a powerful hold on me for so long had finally loosened its grip. I knew that I would probably still feel some anxiety when flying, but now I had the tools to face it with mindfulness. I finally feel free.”

                Every day he would see that many frustrated people, people with tears in their eyes and troubled by various worries were going towards Gautam Buddha and they were very happy while returning. That beggar could not understand what Gautam Buddha used to do to them so that they would become very happy? While returning there was neither a lot of money in the hands of the people nor gold and silver, then what happened that people were so happy while returning from Buddha?

                Thinking all this, the beggar also decided that he too will go to Mahatma Buddha and see what is happening there that unhappy people go to him and become happy?

                He walked to meet Buddha. Where Buddha was present, there was a very long queue, so that beggar also got in the queue. He started waiting in the queue for his turn. His turn came and he reached near Buddha.

                He said to Buddha, “Buddha I am very poor. I have nothing. I have to beg others even to run my life. Now you tell me that how can I live my life and how can I do it better? “

                On hearing all this the Buddha said, “You are not poor. You think so because till date you have never done anything for anyone. Neither have you ever donated anything to anyone. Nor have you done anything for others.”

                Hearing all this, the beggar was in dilemma. To allay his confusion, the beggar asked, “I am a beggar. How can I donate to people and help people? I have to ask others to run my own life.”

                After hearing all this, Gautam Buddha kept quiet for a while and then said to him, “You have a hand with which you can serve people and do good to others. Also you have mouth so that you say good things and encourage others. You can help others by doing all this. It is not necessary that donations be made only with money. We can also donate education if we want. If the God has given someone a perfectly good body, then he is not poor. He is simply poor in mind. He should move away from this thought and serve others. “

                After listening to all these things of Buddha, that beggar became very happy and his mind was satisfied now.

                Moral of the story – We all waste time worrying that we are poor but this is not true. The truth is that as long as our body is completely better, we can use it to move forward and improve our life. If a person just pays attention to his poverty and does not try to change it then he is a fool.

                Apart from this, we also learn from this story that donations, not only money, education, food, good thoughts, etc. should also be made. If you do not have money, you can education others or you can also share good thoughts to others. This makes society better.

He remained calm and silent. In such a situation, the man again abused Gautam Buddha and started saying bad things about his ancestors, but still Mahatma Buddha did not give him any response and he kept calm.

                Seeing all this, his disciples and the people around him were wondering why Mahatma Buddha is not giving any answer to that person?

                After some time the person calmed down on his own. Then, the Buddha said, “If someone gives us a gift, it is up to us whether we take it or not. If we accept it, it comes to us. Whereas if we don’t accept it So it goes to the same person who gave the gift. Similarly, it is up to me to accept or not to abort this person. We should never react immediately. We should always calm down and think about right or wrong. It helps to avoid the worst and also gets rid of troubles. “

                After hearing all these things of Buddha, that person became embarrassed and immediately fell at Buddha’s feet and started apologizing to him. The Buddha forgave him and went ahead.

                Now, when that disciple looked around, no source of water was found anywhere. But when he tried more, he found a source of water on the way.

                There he saw that some people are washing clothes in the source of that water. Then suddenly a bullock cart from there passed over the source of that water. In such a situation, all the water there became dirty and the water became muddy. Then he thought that how can he take that dirty water and muddy water for Buddha?

                So he went back empty-handed and went to Gautam Buddha. He told everyrhing to Buddha. Buddha said that okay don’t worry. We all sit here and relax in the shade of this big tree.

                After some time Gautama Buddha asked the same disciple to bring water again. Now that disciple went back to the same water source. Going there he saw that the water was absolutely clean and was potable. Now he took that water for the Buddha. He gave that water to Gautam Buddha.

                Buddha told everyone that the way mud or the dust spread in the water. But after leaving it for a while, all his mud or dirt sat down and the water cleared back.

                No decision should be taken with a restless mind. All we have to do is to keep our brain calm for a while so that we can make good decisions. Children’s stories.

                Moral of the story- Decisions taken from a restless mind are always wrong. We should always make a decision with a calm mind, which reduces the chances of making mistakes.

            There was a garden near the palace of King Śuddhodana(Father of Gautam Buddha) where Siddharth used to sit and enjoy nature. One day while he was sitting in his garden, an injured swan fell near his leg. There was an arrow in his body. On seeing the swan, it seemed that some hunter has hunted him.

                Seeing the swan in trouble and seeing it fluttering, Siddhartha’s heart melted and he wanted to help the swan.

                He first took that arrow from the body of that swan and bandaged it with ointment on the injured place. After doing all this, Devdutt came to Siddharth looking for something.

                As soon as Devdutt approached Siddhartha, he said, “Well, it is with you. Bring it to me. I have hunted it. I had to work very hard to hunt it and I have the right to it.”

                On hearing this, Siddharth said to Devadatta, “No, this swan was injured and came to me. I helped it and saved his life. That’s why I have the right over it.”

                There was a debate between the two brothers over the rights of that goose. Now they wanted to know who has more right over that swan? So both of them decided that both of them would go to the king. Siddhartha’s father was the king of Kapilavastu.

                They both went to the king Śuddhodana. As soon as they reached the king, Devdutt first said, “Maharaj, I have the highest authority over this swan because I have hunted it. Because of this you ask Siddharth to give me this swan.”

                As soon as Devdutt’s point was completed, the king pacified both and then asked him what was the whole matter?

                In such a situation, Siddhartha told the king the whole thing and said to him, “Father the thing is that this swan was hunted by Devdutt but this swan got injured and came near my feet. Seeing it injured, I treated it and fixed it. Now tell me that the highest authority on this goose is mine. “

                The king considered this matter well. After considering it, he said one of the biggest things in the meeting and that was, “the right to save more than the one who is killed is the highest. Therefore, the biggest authority over this swan is only and only for Siddhartha because he save that swan. He did not kill it, but treated that swan after seeing it injured and saved its life. After the king had said this, Devdutt understood the matter very well. He also knew that the protector has more rights than the one who killed.

                Moral of the story- From this story we understand that the protector is greater than the one who kill and his authority is greater than the one who is killed. That is why we too should help others and help the troubled people. By doing this we make the society around us better. A good society is the hallmark of a good country. That’s why you also pledge from today that you too will definitely help others.

            story8="""Once upon a time, Lord Gautama Buddha was sitting with his disciples and preaching to them. He then told his disciples, “Anger is the greatest enemy of everyone. The person who is angry not only hurts himself but also harms others. He burns in the fire of vengeance and ruins his life.”

                After his preaching was over, one of his disciples stands up and says to him, “You are a hypocrite! Your words are contrary to the way of life of men. You do not follow what you say, in your life. And tells others to do it all.”

                When his disciple was saying these things to Gautam Buddha, Gautam Buddha did not react and he was sitting silent. But, in such a situation, the person became even more angry and in anger, he spit on the mouth of Gautam Buddha! Even after this, Mahatma Gautama Buddha did not get angry and he was calm. He wiped the spit from his face and he sat quietly.

                Seeing all this, that disciple did not understand what he would do. Enraged, he left that place and went to his house the next day. By the time he reached his home, his mind had calmed down. At the end he realized that he had made a big mistake. He has sinned. He began to say to himself in his mind, “What have I done. I have insulted Mahatma Buddha. How can I commit such a sin. I made a big mistake. I have to go and apologize to him.”

                Saying this, he immediately went to Gautama Buddha but Gautama Buddha was not at that place. In such a situation, the disciple wandered from place to place and started searching for him. As soon as he got the Buddha, he fell at his feet and started saying to him, “Forgive me. I have made a mistake. I have insulted you. I have committed this great sin.”

                When Gautam Buddha asked this, he was shocked. He started thinking how Mahatma Buddha could forget him. He had insulted him.

                Thinking this, he asked Mahatma Buddha, “I am the same disciple who insulted you yesterday and you forgot me so soon.”

                “We should leave the things of yesterday. Whether it is good or bad, we should not think about it again and again. I leave the past and go forward and so should all of us.” Mahatma Buddha said to that disciple.

                Once Buddha was walking from one town to another with a few of his disciples. While they were travelling, they happened to pass a lake. As Buddha was thirsty, he told one of his disciples to get some water from the lake.

                The disciple gladly obliged and walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that a few people were washing their clothes in the lake and right at that moment, a bullock cart was crossing through the lake. As a result, the water had become muddy and foul. The disciple couldn’t possibly take the dirty water to Buddha. So he returned to Buddha and told him the water was dirty and not fit to drink.

                A half hour later, Buddha again told the disciple to get water from the same lake. The disciple, though perplexed, obediently agreed and walked up to the lake. This time, however, the disciple noticed that the water was crystal clean. The mud had settled down and the water was fit to drink. So he collected some water in a pot and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the pot of water and smiled.

                He said, “See what you did to make the water clean? You did nothing. You just let it be. The mud settled on its own and you got pure water. Your mind is exactly like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it some time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put any effort to calm your mind. It will happen. It’s effortless.”

                Buddha’s message is crystal clear. Achieving inner peace is effortless. It is not something to struggle for. It is an effortless process which will happen on its own. The practice of mindfulness is central to Buddhist philosophy where one observes the thoughts without passing any judgment or reacting to them. There are several mindfulness meditation techniques that can help us in achieving a calm and peaceful state of mind.

                    My daughter reminded me one morning of the importance of laughter in our lives. She was sitting on the floor, playing and laughing out loud with her six-month-old daughter. I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter’s giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through...I listened as her laughter, and my granddaughter's giggles filled all the space around me. She said she wanted to feel this kind of joy always and see the world through her child’s merry eyes.
                    We talked about the carefree laughter of childhood before we had bills to pay and so many responsibilities.
                    I asked my daughter, "So what makes you laugh when you get older, and the children are grown, and you no longer have to leave cookies out for Santa?"
                    "I don’t know, Mom, she said. That’s what I’m expecting you to show me."
                    That’s the thing about children; when you think they are grown and you’ve set good examples for them, they remind you that they’re still watching.
                    Our children grew up in a pastor's home with many different kinds of people coming and going in their lives in many different places. Teaching our children to have a sense of humor was just as important as teaching them to have a strong prayer life.
                    One of my many favorite memories of laughing together as a pastor's family was when a precious older member of our church, who was almost blind with cataracts, would prepare meals and bring them to us. She didn't realize that she mixed all the food on one big serving plate.
                    The fried fish was often on top of cottage cheese and pineapple with beans and slaw on top of that. The children wouldn't eat the food and didn't know what to say when she asked them at church how their dinner was.
                    A pastor friend suggested we name our garbage can "Spot." So when the sweet lady asked the kids how the food was, they would say, "It hit the spot!" Laughter always made our lives fun and helped us get through stressful times.
                    We need laughter in the good times and the bad. Laughter makes us feel good, releases pressure in a bad situation, gives us energy, and makes the most miserable situation bearable at times. In general, it gives us a sense of well-being and a sense of community.
                    Doctor Madan Kataria, author of the book, Laughter Yoga, said, "Children can laugh up to 400 times a day, but for adults, this frequency drops to barely 15 times a day."
                    It may even be less this year with all the stress our country and families have been through.
                    In 1995 Dr. Kataria, a medical doctor from Mumbai, India, experimented with humor’s therapeutic benefits by approaching strangers in a park in Mumbai. He then invented a series of breathing and relaxation exercises that stimulate merriment for better health called Laughter Yoga.
                    Since then, thousands of social laughter clubs have been launched in 65 countries, including the United States.
                    Some physicians prescribe laughter classes to the sick, elderly, young, and healthy for its stress-reducing effects. It is proven that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter.
                    The physical benefits of laughter include reducing stress hormones, strengthening our immune system, cardiac conditioning, lower blood pressure, {especially in women), and it cleanses the lungs, which can aid in respiratory problems.
                    Good reason to add laughter to our lives daily, right?
                    When I added up the amount of laughter in my life, I found that most of the people I spend time with are people who like to laugh.
                    As inspiration, I look no further than my own friends and family. My neighbor and friend is one particular person who inspires me. She is engaged, curious, strong, beautiful, and fun at age 89 ? exactly the kind of woman I'd love to be when I'm her age, should I have the good fortune to live that long in fine health.
                    Listening to her share funny stories of stressful times in her life growing up during the great depression reminds me that there is a funny side to every situation. Spending any time with her reinforces the idea that we need a sense of humor to make it through the tough times in life and gives me new energy and hope for the future.
                    My sisters, who were all more than ten years older than me, inspired me the same way. They knew how to use laughter as a healing agent. When we got together, we talk about our life as children. There were sad and painful times for us, but we always managed to turn our shared stories and thoughts into laugher that brought tears to our eyes.
                    During the Covid-19 quarantine, I had an amazing friend who sent me videos of funny things and attitudes to cope with the quarantine. She says we need more comedy in our lives, and she is right. The videos were respectfully humorous, and they helped me laugh at myself.
                    Laughter doesn’t mean you can’t be serious or that you are insensitive to the bad things happening in the world around us.
                    However, it can be the difference between a life of black-and-white and a life filled with color. Laughter may not add years to your life, but it will add life to your years! It’s like a flower that blooms when it stretches towards the sun.
                    A wise person realizes eating right and exercise is the best way to stay healthy, and it is a wise person who learns the importance of laughter in their lives.
                    If we need a prescription for laughter, it can be found in a book that has been around a long, long time. A Bible verse in Proverbs reminds us that joy is an important part of a healthy life. "A merry heart is good like a medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength." (17:22, NLT)
                    Laughing with our grandchildren is the most fun, and we do it a lot. Sometimes when our grandchildren get into trouble, we laugh and remind our children they did the same things when they were that age. But, for some reason, they don't always think that's funny.
                    However, being a role model for our adult children has meant demonstrating how to live well and happy in good times and bad. Teaching them always to have a sense of humor and a strong prayer life will be their guide to setting the same example for their children."""

                    Many frogs lived in the Champakan pond. Kanduk was a jovial frog. He loved to make other frogs laugh. One day, while Kanduk was entertaining his friends in the pond, King Sher Singh came there to have a bath. Unfortunately, the king stepped on one of Kanduk’s legs and it broke. Kanduk screamed in pain. The king immediately admitted him to the hospital for treatment.

Now wherever he went, he would praise his wooden leg a lot. Once Kanduk’s friend Champa, the squirrel was unwell. She was down with typhoid and was admitted to the hospital. When Kanduk heard about it, he went to visit her along with his brother Tandul.
                    The hospital was crowded with patients and visitors. Kanduk decided to entertain all the patients and began narrating the story about his wooden leg. He said, “Having a wooden leg has its benefits. It cannot get injured and so does not pain!”  Then he called a patient and gave him a stick. “Hit and see.” That patient, Uluk hit Kanduk’s leg with all his might. Kanduk started laughing. He said, “See, I didn’t get hurt.” Everybody smiled looking at Kanduk. After visiting Champa, Kanduk and Tandul returned home. Kanduk began stroking his leg. Seeing this, Tandul asked, “What happened?”  “Uluk hit me on my real leg by mistake. If I wouldn’t have laughed, how would I have brought smiles on so many faces? It was a small price to pay to make others laugh.” said Kanduk and laughed out loud. Tandul was amazed and said “You are great! Kanduk. You can laugh despite the pain. Laughter is the best Medicine.”

                story3="""Many years ago, Norman Cousins was diagnosed as “terminally ill”. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500.
                    He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to, and perhaps helped cause, his disease. He wondered, “If illness can be caused by negativity, can wellness be created by positivity?”
                    He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughter was one of the most positive activities he knew. He rented all the funny movies he could find – Keaton, Chaplin, Fields, the Marx Brothers. (This was before VCRs, so he had to rent the actual films.) He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something funny.
                    His pain was so great he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep.
                    He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy, healthy and productive years. (His journey is detailed in his book, Anatomy of an Illness.) He credits visualization, the love of his family and friends, and laughter for his recovery.
                    Some people think laughter is a waste of time. It is a luxury, they say, a frivolity, something to indulge in only every so often.
                    Nothing could be further from the truth. Laughter is essential to our equilibrium, to our well-being, to our aliveness. If we’re not well, laughter helps us get well; if we are well, laughter helps us stay that way.
                    Since Cousins’ ground-breaking subjective work, scientific studies have shown that laughter has a curative effect on the body, the mind and the emotions.
                    So, if you like laughter, consider it sound medical advice to indulge in it as often as you can. If you don’t like laughter, then take your medicine – laugh anyway.
                    Use whatever makes you laugh – movies, sitcoms, Monty Python, records, books, New Yorker cartoons, jokes, friends.
                    Give yourself permission to laugh – long and loud and out loud – whenever anything strikes you as funny. The people around you may think you’re strange, but sooner or later they’ll join in even if they don’t know what you’re laughing about.
                    Some diseases may be contagious, but none is as contagious as the cure. . . laughter.

                    “Oh. Hello.” She tried to sound normal. She didn’t feel normal. She felt like she was teetering on the edge of something. That feeling where you’re not sure if it’s laughter or tears — both hysterical — that will come out of your body.
                    “I’m lichen it.” His voice was deep, laconic. Australian.
                    “What?” Her brow furrowed. The green mask hid her mouth.
                    “I’m lichen it.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. The weird feeling was still there. Tears? Laughter? She wasn’t sure, but when it came, she knew she’d have no control. None.
                    You see, she’d been locked inside her two-roomed ‘palace’ for 21 days. The whole weird world lockdown had triggered her already fragile self into going into herself, into self-isolation. For longer than 14 days because…well…you never can tell. I mean, perhaps she had touched a metal hand-rail when she took the train, or when she’d walked into the toilets at the cinema. There were germs everywhere. And now they had a name.
                    “Barry.” She looked at him, fully into his face, her mouth a little slack with surprise. Her eyes, wide.
                    “What?” She wondered if he some kind of telepathy.
                    “My name. Barry. And I’m lichen it!” He grinned at her. The lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled. And his eyes twinkled. The smile was cheeky. He had no mask. Brave. His brown hair flopped onto his forehead. He had a black t-shirt on, AC/DC on the front.
                    She must have looked a little puzzled. Although he could only see her eyes, they must have shown her confusion. He started to laugh. It was a deep laugh. Straight from his belly. It was lovely!
                    “The bench! We’re sitting on…” he gesticulated. His hands were broad and capable. Clean too. Fingernails, neat. Blonde hairs on the backs of his hand glistened in the sun.
                    It was then she noticed. She who notices everything. Every hair follicle. Every leaf on every tree. Every blade of grass. Every freckle dusting Barry’s arm.
                    The bench was covered in lichen!
                    She felt it. Not the lichen but the laughter. Bubbling up, like a soda bottle, shaken not stirred. It bubbled up and up and out of her! Such laughter, a beautiful sound! A beautiful feeling! The lichen!
                    “I’m lichen it!” he grinned at her again, obviously glad she had reacted.
                    She pulled at the mask hiding her mouth, gulping the air as the laughter came, flowing like a stream.
                    How could she be laughing? With a stranger? On a park bench? At this time in the world’s history?
                    But it wouldn’t be stopped. It flowed! Her every nerve, cell, neuron, given life by laughter, glowed in the sunlight. She put the mask down next to her.
                    “So, you’re a lichen expert then,” she chortled, leaning over with the laughter pouring out of her. He began to laugh too.
                    “I know what I’m lichen,” he replied, “And I’m lichen you!” His whole face contorted as his laughter burst out of him! He slapped his thigh, leaning backward and forwards as the hilarity took control of him.
                    She tried to reply, feeling the peeling lichen under her hands. Laughter had taken control of her. All her fears disappeared in wave after wave of glorious giggles.
                    She stood up, held her hand out to him.
                    “Come on, Barry! I’m lichen you too! Let’s make like a tree and leave!” She let out a huge gust of laughter. Barry grabbed her hand and stood up, laughing his wonderful belly laugh.
                    They wandered off. Who knows where? Nothing was open so perhaps they went back to her place. She left the mask behind.

                    Mom dragged the sack into the kitchen of our home in suburban Sherwood Park, Alta. My 10-year-old brother came into the room: “What’s in there? It’s moving.”
                    I gave a piercing, seven-year-old-girl shriek. Something in the lumpy bag was struggling to escape. Mom spun around. “Oh, shi—shoot. Take it to the garage.”
                    My brother hauled the bag away. In the garage, Mom grabbed the axe from its spot on the wall. Dark-jacketed men, mysterious packages and now axes, I thought. It was turning out to be an interesting day.
                    Mom approached the bag like a bomb-squad member, opened the top and retreated a few feet. There was a rustle and then a chicken with a partially detached head blasted out. Dad was a thrifty man, unable to resist the Hutterite’s price for unplucked, freshly killed (or, in this case, mostly killed) poultry.
                    The chicken, delighted to be free of the cramped bag and its deceased kin, made several leaps around our garage, like a spasmodic ballerina. Mom’s former-farm-girl know-how abandoned her, and she looked a little sick. She handed my brother (whose closest experience with a live chicken was an undercooked nugget) the axe. “Chop its head off,” she said.
                    “Okay.” He took a half step forward, turned pale, then handed the axe back. “You chop it off.”
                    The hen ran in enthusiastic circles, letting out garbled squawks, more bothered by captivity than its neck problem. It darted toward us, wings flapping, feathers shedding. We all screamed and tried to hide behind one another. The bird darted away, terrified. Mom admitted defeat, herded us inside and called my father. Until he arrived, she eyed the door as though the chicken might grab the axe itself and hack its way through.
                    Hours later, I snuck out to the garage. No more chicken, and the axe was back on the wall. When I asked Dad what happened to the animal, he told me it had run away.
                    For months I watched in vain for a droopy-headed chicken lurking in the neighbourhood. To my dad’s credit, no more dark-suited men carrying bags ever arrived at our door again. And, many years later, my brother, still horrified, exclaims, “Mom handed me the axe.”

                    A long time ago there was a boy. He was smart, talented and handsome. However, he was very selfish and his temper was so difficult, that nobody wanted to be friends with him. Often he got angry and said various hurtful things to people around him.
                    The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                    The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                    Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                    One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                    Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.
                    Much time had passed and at last the boy could be proud of himself as all the nails were gone. When he came to his father and told him about this, his father offered to come and take a careful look at the fence.
                    You did a good job, my son, but pay your attention to the holes that have been left from the nails. The fence will never be the same. The same happens when you say hurtful things to people. Your words leave scars in their hearts like those holes in the fence. Remember, we need to treat everyone with love and respect, because it doesn’t matter that you say you are sorry, the scars will not disappear.

                story_raudra2=  '''Back in the 1960s, a Harvard graduate student made a landmark discovery about anger.
                    At age 34, Jean Briggs traveled above the Arctic Circle and lived out on the tundra for 17 months. There were no roads, no heating systems, no grocery stores. Winter temperatures could easily dip below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
                    Briggs persuaded an Inuit family to “adopt” her and “try to keep her alive,” as the anthropologist wrote in 1970.
                    At the time, many Inuit families lived similar to the way their ancestors had for thousands of years. They built igloos in the winter and tents in the summer. “And we ate only what the animals provided, such as fish, seal and caribou,” says Myna Ishulutak, a film producer and language teacher who lived a similar lifestyle as a young girl.
                    Briggs quickly realized something remarkable was going on in these families: The adults had an extraordinary ability to control their anger.
                    “They never acted in anger toward me, although they were angry with me an awful lot,” Briggs told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview.
                    Even just showing a smidgen of frustration or irritation was considered weak and childlike, Briggs observed.
                    For instance, one time someone knocked a boiling pot of tea across the igloo, damaging the ice floor. No one changed their expression. “Too bad,” the offender said calmly and went to refill the teapot.
                    In another instance, a fishing line — which had taken days to braid — immediately broke on the first use. No one flinched in anger. “Sew it together,” someone said quietly.
                    By contrast, Briggs seemed like a wild child, even though she was trying very hard to control her anger. “My ways were so much cruder, less considerate and more impulsive,” she told the CBC. “[I was] often impulsive in an antisocial sort of way. I would sulk or I would snap or I would do something that they never did.”
                    Briggs, who died in 2016, wrote up her observations in her first book, Never in Anger. But she was left with a lingering question: How do Inuit parents instill this ability in their children? How do Inuit take tantrum-prone toddlers and turn them into cool-headed adults?
                    Then in 1971, Briggs found a clue.
                    She was walking on a stony beach in the Arctic when she saw a young mother playing with her toddler — a little boy about 2 years old. The mom picked up a pebble and said, “‘Hit me! Go on. Hit me harder,'” Briggs remembered.
                    The boy threw the rock at his mother, and she exclaimed, “Ooooww. That hurts!”
                    Briggs was completely befuddled. The mom seemed to be teaching the child the opposite of what parents want. And her actions seemed to contradict everything Briggs knew about Inuit culture.
                    “I thought, ‘What is going on here?’ ” Briggs said in the radio interview.
                    Turns out, the mom was executing a powerful parenting tool to teach her child how to control his anger — and one of the most intriguing parenting strategies I’ve come across.
                    No scolding, no timeouts
                    It’s early December in the Arctic town of Iqaluit, Canada. And at 2 p.m., the sun is already calling it a day. Outside, the temperature is a balmy minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. A light snow is swirling.
                    I’ve come to this seaside town, after reading Briggs’ book, in search of parenting wisdom, especially when it comes to teaching children to control their emotions. Right off the plane, I start collecting data.
                    I sit with elders in their 80s and 90s while they lunch on “country food” —stewed seal, frozen beluga whale and raw caribou. I talk with moms selling hand-sewn sealskin jackets at a high school craft fair. And I attend a parenting class, where day care instructors learn how their ancestors raised small children hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of years ago.
                    Across the board, all the moms mention one golden rule: Don’t shout or yell at small children.
                    Traditional Inuit parenting is incredibly nurturing and tender. If you took all the parenting styles around the world and ranked them by their gentleness, the Inuit approach would likely rank near the top. (They even have a special kiss for babies, where you put your nose against the cheek and sniff the skin.)
                    The culture views scolding — or even speaking to children in an angry voice — as inappropriate, says Lisa Ipeelie, a radio producer and mom who grew up with 12 siblings. “When they’re little, it doesn’t help to raise your voice,” she says. “It will just make your own heart rate go up.”
                    Even if the child hits you or bites you, there’s no raising your voice?
                    “No,” Ipeelie says with a giggle that seems to emphasize how silly my question is. “With little kids, you often think they’re pushing your buttons, but that’s not what’s going on. They’re upset about something, and you have to figure out what it is.”
                    Traditionally, the Inuit saw yelling at a small child as demeaning. It’s as if the adult is having a tantrum; it’s basically stooping to the level of the child, Briggs documented.
                    Elders I spoke with say intense colonization over the past century is damaging these traditions. And, so, the community is working hard to keep the parenting approach intact.
                    Goota Jaw is at the front line of this effort. She teaches the parenting class at the Arctic College. Her own parenting style is so gentle that she doesn’t even believe in giving a child a timeout for misbehaving.
                    “Shouting, ‘Think about what you just did. Go to your room!’ ” Jaw says. “I disagree with that. That’s not how we teach our children. Instead you are just teaching children to run away.”
                    And you are teaching them to be angry, says clinical psychologist and author Laura Markham. “When we yell at a child — or even threaten with something like ‘I’m starting to get angry,’ we’re training the child to yell,” says Markham. “We’re training them to yell when they get upset and that yelling solves problems.”
                    In contrast, parents who control their own anger are helping their children learn to do the same, Markham says. “Kids learn emotional regulation from us.”
                    I asked Markham if the Inuit’s no-yelling policy might be their first secret of raising cool-headed kids. “Absolutely,” she says.
                    Playing soccer with your head
                    Now at some level, all moms and dads know they shouldn’t yell at kids. But if you don’t scold or talk in an angry tone, how do you discipline? How do you keep your 3-year-old from running into the road? Or punching her big brother?
                    For thousands of years, the Inuit have relied on an ancient tool with an ingenious twist: “We use storytelling to discipline,” Jaw says.
                    Jaw isn’t talking about fairy tales, where a child needs to decipher the moral. These are oral stories passed down from one generation of Inuit to the next, designed to sculpt kids’ behaviors in the moment. Sometimes even save their lives.
                    For example, how do you teach kids to stay away from the ocean, where they could easily drown? Instead of yelling, “Don’t go near the water!” Jaw says Inuit parents take a pre-emptive approach and tell kids a special story about what’s inside the water. “It’s the sea monster,” Jaw says, with a giant pouch on its back just for little kids.
                    “If a child walks too close to the water, the monster will put you in his pouch, drag you down to the ocean and adopt you out to another family,” Jaw says.
                    “Then we don’t need to yell at a child,” Jaw says, “because she is already getting the message.”
                    Inuit parents have an array of stories to help children learn respectful behavior, too. For example, to get kids to listen to their parents, there is a story about ear wax, says film producer Myna Ishulutak.
                    “My parents would check inside our ears, and if there was too much wax in there, it meant we were not listening,” she says.
                    And parents tell their kids: If you don’t ask before taking food, long fingers could reach out and grab you, Ishulutak says.
                    Then there’s the story of northern lights, which helps kids learn to keep their hats on in the winter.
                    “Our parents told us that if we went out without a hat, the northern lights are going to take your head off and use it as a soccer ball,” Ishulutak says. “We used to be so scared!” she exclaims and then erupts in laughter.
                    At first, these stories seemed to me a bit too scary for little children. And my knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss them. But my opinion flipped 180 degrees after I watched my own daughter’s response to similar tales — and after I learned more about humanity’s intricate relationship with storytelling
                    Oral storytelling is what’s known as a human universal. For tens of thousands of years, it has been a key way that parents teach children about values and how to behave.
                    Modern hunter-gatherer groups use stories to teach sharing, respect for both genders and conflict avoidance, a recent study reported, after analyzing 89 different tribes. With the Agta, a hunter-gatherer population of the Philippines, good storytelling skills are prized more than hunting skills or medicinal knowledge, the study found.
                    Today many American parents outsource their oral storytelling to screens. And in doing so, I wonder if we’re missing out on an easy — and effective — way of disciplining and changing behavior. Could small children be somehow “wired” to learn through stories?
                    “Well, I’d say kids learn well through narrative and explanations,” says psychologist Deena Weisberg at Villanova University, who studies how small children interpret fiction. “We learn best through things that are interesting to us. And stories, by their nature, can have lots of things in them that are much more interesting in a way that bare statements don’t.”
                    Stories with a dash of danger pull in kids like magnets, Weisberg says. And they turn a tension-ridden activity like disciplining into a playful interaction that’s — dare, I say it — fun.
                    “Don’t discount the playfulness of storytelling,” Weisberg says. “With stories, kids get to see stuff happen that doesn’t really happen in real life. Kids think that’s fun. Adults think it’s fun, too.”
                    Why don’t you hit me?
                    Back up in Iqaluit, Myna Ishulutak is reminiscing about her childhood out on the land. She and her family lived in a hunting camp with about 60 other people. When she was a teenager, her family settled in a town.
                    “I miss living on the land so much,” she says as we eat a dinner of baked Arctic char. “We lived in a sod house. And when we woke up in the morning, everything would be frozen until we lit the oil lamp.”
                    I ask her if she’s familiar with the work of Jean Briggs. Her answer leaves me speechless.
                    Ishulutak reaches into her purse and brings out Briggs’ second book, Inuit Morality Play, which details the life of a 3-year-old girl dubbed Chubby Maata.
                    “This book is about me and my family,” Ishulutak says. “I am Chubby Maata.”
                    In the early 1970s, when Ishulutak was about 3 years old, her family welcomed Briggs into their home for six months and allowed her to study the intimate details of their child’s day-to-day life.
                    What Briggs documented is a central component to raising cool-headed kids.
                    When a child in the camp acted in anger — hit someone or had a tantrum — there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, “the play’s the thing wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.”)
                    “The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,” Briggs told the CBC in 2011.
                    In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior.
                    The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave.
                    For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: “Why don’t you hit me?”
                    Then the child has to think: “What should I do?” If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn’t scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. “Ow, that hurts!” she might exclaim.
                    The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: “Don’t you like me?” or “Are you a baby?” She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people’s feelings, and “big girls” wouldn’t hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness.
                    The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends.
                    Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. “They teach you to be strong emotionally,” she says, “to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.”
                    Psychologist Peggy Miller, at the University of Illinois, agrees: “When you’re little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.”
                    In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they’re not actually angry.
                    This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here’s the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it — even for adults.
                    “When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that’s a really hard thing to do,” says Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work.
                    But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you’re not angry, you’ll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says.
                    “That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,” she says.
                    This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids’ brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control.
                    “Children have all kinds of big emotions,” she says. “They don’t have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child’s emotions shapes their brain.”
                    Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out.
                    “Those approaches develop self-control,” Markham says.
                    Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,”Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?”
                    Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior.
                    “Play is their work,” Markham says. “That’s how they learn about the world and about their experiences.” '''

                story_raudra3= '''Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the Princess who lived there married a Prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet Princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the Prince to live alone for a long time.
                    The Prince’s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the Prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn’t take long for the Prince to find it again
                    The palace tried to escape many times but the Prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the Prince’s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the Prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the Prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the Prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold.
                    “The North Pole? How do I get out of here?” wondered the Prince as he explored his new surroundings.
                    After searching all morning and finding nothing, the Prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the Prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face.
                    “Stupid palace! It seems angry with me!”
                    The palace was indeed angry with the Prince and shook all its windows to let him know.
                    “So that’s the way you want it?” shouted the Prince. “Well, get ready, because this is war. And I have never lost a battle.”
                    In the days that followed, the Prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the Prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the Prince’s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the Prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the Prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish Prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the Prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day.
                    Much to his surprise, the Prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the Prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country.
                    They arrived just before the Princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the Prince’s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.
                    The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don’t let your anger and temper cause it any damage...'''

                story_raudra5= '''Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin woman Mohini with her husband Ramji in a small village. Ramji used to perform small puja ceremonies in the homes and the temple of the village to earn his livelihood. Ramji was a very honest and polite human being but his wife Mohini was rude and arrogant. She had a bad habit of getting angry on petty issues and she always lost senses in anger. She used to do and say totally opposite of whatever Ramji said whenever she became angry.
                    One day Mohini told angrily to Ramji, "How will I run this house in your small income? Why don't you buy two bulls and start farming on your land?"
                    Ramji: "But we have a very small land and we do not need bulls for it."
                    Mohini: "No, we have a very big land .... Are you blind and stupid? .... I want the bulls in this house by tomorrow."
                    Short story for kids: Anger is the best friend of fools.
                    Poor Ramji went to the animal market and purchased two bulls. As he had a small land, he started giving the bulls on rent to other people also. He also worked hard day and night in his field to keep Mohini happy but could not bring any change in her. One day he returned tired from his field and said to his wife
                    "Mohini, I do not want to eat chapatti today, please cook rice today"
                    Mohini replied as usual, "No, I will bake chapatis today"
                    Ramji: " Ok, but please, let the bulls rest inside the shed today .... It's very cold outside."
                    Mohini: "My bulls are very strong .... They are not like you .... They will sleep outside."
                    Ramji was very irritated with her behaviour but kept quiet. The next day Mohini's brother came to visit them. He wanted to borrow their bull for some days.
                    Ramji said, "I still have some work left, you can take the bull after three days."
                    Mohini in anger, "How dare you deny my brother? .... Brother, You take the bull today only."
                    With this answer of Mohini, an idea occurred in Ramji's mind.
                    "Ok, brother in law, take the bull with you but don't request to take your sister with you .... It's very hard to spend a single day without her."
                    Mohini: "I will go to my Parents place with my brother .... Let me see, who is going to stop me."
                    Ramji: "But, come back soon darling .... I cannot live alone for many days."
                    Mohini: "I am not going to return before two- three months .... After all I am going to meet my parents after so many days."
                    Ramji was very happy. He thought that now he will live in peace for some months. Mohini packed her suitcase and left with her brother along with the two bulls. Ramji walked with them up to the village river. When they reached the river which usually had water level up to the knee, they saw that the water level of the river had become a little high.
                    Ramji said, " I think you both should not go today .... None of you know swimming."
                    Mohini in anger: "No matter what, I am going to my parents place today."
                    Mohini's brother: "Sister, we can cross the river by getting hold on to the tail of the bulls .... and we can tie our luggage on their backs "
                    Mohini: "Let's cross the river then."
                    Like this, the two of them moved ahead in the river by catching the tail of the bulls. Mohini was with one bull and her brother with the other bull. When they reached the middle of the river, the water came to the neck of Mohini. Ramji was watching them from the bank and he was very worried for his wife and brother in law.
                    Ramji shouted from the bank, "Mohini, please hold the tail of the bull tightly"
                    Mohini on listening his voice shouted back: "How dare you advise me? .... I am leaving the tail just now.
                    Ramji: "No .... Mohini .... No...."
                    Before he could complete his sentence, Mohini left the tail of the bull and was drowned in the river. Ramji could do nothing but cry on the anger of his wife which ultimately led her to the end of life.

                    Moral of the story:

                    Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
                    In anger we lose our capability to understand. It is also said that anger only dwells in the bosom of the fools. So, we should learn to control our anger and keep ourselves calm and at peace then only we can make wise decisions in life.'''

                    The boy‘s parents very concerned about his bad temper. They considered what they could do and one day the father had an idea. He called his son and gave him a hammer and a bag of nails. The father said: Every time you get angry, take a nail and drive into that old fence as hard as you can.
                    The fence was very tough and the hammer was heavy, nevertheless the boy was so furious that during the very first day he has driven 37 nails.
                    Day after day, week after week, the number of nails was gradually decreasing. After some time, the boy started to understand that holding his temper is easier that driving nails into the fence.
                    One day the boy didn’t need the hammer and nails anymore, as he had learned to hold his temper perfectly. So he came to his father and told about his achievement.
                    Now, every time when you hold your temper all day long, pull out one nail.

She took a plate for her breakfast. Her hand mistakenly touched the glass of milk and the milk spilled over Parth's uniform.
                    The ripple effects of anger
                    "Oh……no! Look, what have you done! Can't you look before you take your plate?" Parth screamed at Bhakti. His face turned red with anger.
                    "I am so sorry, Parth. I didn't mean to……." Bhakti said regretfully but Parth didn't even let Bhakti finish her apology and ran to his room to change. 
                    "His other uniform was not ironed. "Now, what will I wear? How can I wear this stained uniform?" thought Parth, still very angry at Bhakti. He had no other option than to wear the crumpled uniform. He heard the bus driver honk outside but he hadn't even packed his bag yet. Eventually, his mother let the school bus go and dropped Parth to school.
                    He was praying all the way that his class teacher should be in a good mood and pardon his coming late. But no prayers of pardons seemed to work for D.K sir. Parth's punishment was to go out on the ground and run one mile. He felt very embarrassed. All the way while running, Parth was burning inside. He blamed Bhakti for his punishment and was waiting to return home and scold her.
                    He was very tired and exhausted because of his anger. When he returned home, he saw that Bhakti was studying for her geography test. "Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu", Bhakti was memorizing the capitals of Indian states. Parth entered the room and heard Bhakti's voice.
                    "You fool! Chennai is not the capital, Madras is the capital of Tamilnadu", saying that he snatched her geography notebook and tore her page. Parth was always convinced that he was right. Poor Bhakti collected the torn pieces of paper with tears in her eyes. This was Parth's way of getting even with Bhakti.             
                    Just then, they heard their mother's call for dinner. "Come on, kids dinner is ready. I have made pau-bhaji today", Mummy said.
                    "What…..pau-bhaji?? But I had asked you to make pizza tonight!! Why don't you ever listen to me?" Parth exploded. But a stare from Mummy was enough to make him finish his dinner. He gulped his dinner as fast as he could and rushed to his room.
                    After some time, his father returned from work. He came to Parth's room. Parth was lying on his bed reading something. "How was your day, dear?" Papa asked. Parth broke down and told his father about his eventful day.
                    The ripple effects of anger2
                    His father listened to him attentively and then calmly said, "Spilling milk was just an accident. You became angry because you felt that you incurred a loss and were embarrassed to go to school in a crumpled uniform. But have you never spilled anything in your life before? And then you felt insulted because you were punished. But, tell me, will you miss your bus if you make it a habit to pack your bag the night before?
                    You were burning with anger and you tore Bhakti's notebook page and hurt her. Then you exploded on Mummy because you didn't get pizza for dinner. You know Parth, a person becomes angry when things don't go his way and such a person burns from within and then hurts others. Do you like to burn?"
                    Parth mumbled, "No. I don't like that feeling at all. But what should I do now?"
                    "You should ask for forgiveness from Bhakti and Mummy because you have hurt them with your anger and you should resolve never to get angry again". Papa said. "And, by the way, the new name for Madras is Chennai!" He winked at Parth as he left the room.
                    Parth realised his mistake and instantly asked for forgiveness and decided strongly not to get angry again with anybody.

                    Moral: The person is hurt when you become angry with him & hurting others bind bad karmas, results of which have to be compensated in the next life. Dadashri says that anger is a weakness. Those who don't use anger as a weapon have sheel (extraordinary moral character).'''

                    Betal put forward another puzzle to Vikram. A woman called Leelavati married a thief. After marriage the man decided to quit stealing. However, when they had a son, the man found he had no money to support his family and went back to stealing. After his death, Leelavati married a businessman.
                    The businessman loved his family and raised the child well. Just when the boy took charge of the business, his parents died.
                    While performing their last rites in the river, three hands came out claiming the offering. The boy recognised his mother's voice and offered prayers to her, but he couldn't make out which pair of hand was his father's. At this point he recalled his mother once mentioning his real father.
                    Betal stopped the story here and asked which father was finally given the offering.
                    "The businessman," replied Vikram. "Because he had showered his love and reared the child, while the thief had only given him birth." Again, Betal flew away.

                    One day Thomas Edison came home and gave a paper to his mother. He told her, “My teacher gave this paper to me and told me to only give it to my mother.” His mother’s eyes were tearful as she read the letter out loud to her child, “Your son is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn’t have enough good teachers for training him. Please teach him yourself.”
                    Many years after Edison’s mother had died, Edison had become one of the greatest inventors of the century. One day he was going through the old closet and he found a folded letter which was given to him by his teacher for his mother. He opened it. The message written on the letter was, “Your son is mentally ill. We can not let him attend our school anymore. He is expelled.”
                    Edison became emotional reading it and then he wrote in his diary, “Thomas Alva Edison was a mentally ill child whose mother turned him into the genius of the century.”

                    My mother's most generous gift is giving all her time and self to my family.
                    Some background, my parents are immigrants from South Korea. They came here with little more than the clothes on their backs and have raised my brother and I the best way they know how with the little that they had, and that includes time. My parents had their own business and never had enough time for us. That is all in the past, and while I appreciate what they did before, they are even more giving now. Eight years ago ... my mother let me marry a man from South Korea, even though she had her misgivings. I was born and raised in America and am an American in every way, but went and married a Korean man. Through it all, my mother has stood by me and helped us in our struggle to survive, both as a couple and as parents in America. When we came to the states, my husband did not speak English. He was unsure of himself and was not able to find a job. My parents provided a roof for us. We only had one car, my parents gave us one of their spare cars. I don't know how to cook Korean food, so my mother slaved over a stove, after she came home from her work, to give him a traditional Korean meal every night. When we felt that we were able to move out on our own, my parents gave us a loan to buy a home. They gave us one of their vehicles to take with us to our new home. When I went back to work after my second child was born, my mother closed her business and took care of my children so that I could work full-time. To this day, she still watches my children and takes my daughter to and from school. We have purchased a larger home and my parents are still supporting us through this endeavor with their tips and tricks of being homeowners. My mother has no boundaries to the love she gives my family and even though we no longer live with her, she still sends home food for my husband so that he doesn't miss Korea so much.


                    That is how generous my mother is. She gives all she has to us, and more.

                    An 80 year old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45 year’s old highly educated son.
                    Suddenly a crow perched on their window.
                    The Father asked his Son, “What is this?”
                    The Son replied “It is a crow”.
                    After a few minutes, the Father asked his Son the 2nd time, “What is this?”
                    The Son said “Father, I have just now told you “It’s a crow”.
                    After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son the 3rd time,
                    What is this?”
                    At this time some expression of irritation was felt in the Son’s tone when he said to his Father with a rebuff. “It’s a crow, a crow, a crow”.
                    A little after, the Father again asked his Son the 4th time, “What is this?
                    This time the Son shouted at his Father, “Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times ‘IT IS A CROW’.
                    Are you not able to understand this?”
                    A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary:-
                    “Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. 
                    I did not at all feel irritated I rather felt affection for my innocent child”. 
                    While the little child asked him 23 times “What is this”, the Father had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the Son felt irritated and annoyed.
                    From today say this aloud, “I want to see my parents happy forever. They have cared for me ever since I was a little child.
                    They have always showered their selfless love on me.
                    They crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today”.

                    A student asks a teacher, “Why often people marry a different person then they fell in love with?”  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the wheat field and choose the best wheat and come back.  But the rule is that you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the field, went through the first row, he saw one big wheat which he instantly liked, but he wonders that maybe there is a bigger one further.  Then he saw another bigger one, but again he thought that maybe there is an even bigger one waiting for him.
                    Later, when he finished more than half of the wheat field, he started to realize that the wheat is not as big as the ones he let go off, he started to realize that he had missed the best one in the search of a bigger.  So, he ended up going back to the teacher with an empty hand because he just wasn’t able to forgive himself for letting go of the best wheat and described what happened.  The teacher told him, “You kept looking for a better one while letting go of the best one and later when you realize that you have missed that, you can’t go back.  This is the mistake often made by people who fell in love and lost the best person they could have in their life”.
                    So, the student said, “Does that mean, one should never fall in love?”  The Teacher replied, “No Dear,  Anyone can fall in love if they find a suitable person.  But, once you truly fall in love, you must never let go of that person due to your anger, ego or comparisons with others”.
                    “How do they end up marrying someone other than they loved?” the student asked.  The teacher said, “in order to answer your question, go to the corn field and choose the biggest corn and come back. But the rule is same as before, you can go through them only once and cannot turn back to pick.”  The student went to the corn field, this time he was careful to not to repeat the previous mistake.  When he reached to the middle of the field, he picked one medium corn that he felt satisfied with and went back to the teacher.  He described how he made a choice.  The teacher told him, “This time you didn’t came empty handed.  You looked for one that is just nice, and you had put your faith that this is the best one you can get.  This is how one makes a choice for marriage.”
                    The student stood confused.  The teacher asked, “What is bothering you now?”  The student replied, “I am wondering which would have been better, marrying a person you love or loving the person you marry”.  The teacher replied, “It’s a very easy answer, only if you are willing to admit it to yourself”.

                    Two inseparable friends, Sam and Jason, met with an accident on their way to Boston City. The following morning, Jason woke up blind and Sam was still unconscious. Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me. "Dr Berkeley was moved at Sam's deed. All that he could say was, "You are a very brave man Sam and God will make it up to you in one way or another". While he was moving on to the next patient, Sam called back at him almost pleading, "promise me you won't tell Jason anything".
                    "You know I won't do that. Trust me." and walked away.
                    "Thank you " whispered Sam. He smiled and looked up in prayer " I hope I live up to your ideas...please give me the strength to be able to go through this..Amen"
                    Months later when Jason had recuperated considerably, he stopped hanging around with Sam. He felt discouraged and embarrassed to spend time with a disabled person like Sam.
                    Sam was lonely and disheartened ,since he didn't have any body else other than Jason to count on. Things went from bad to worse. And one day Sam died in despair. When Jason was called on his burial, he found a letter waiting for him. Dr Berkeley gave it to him with an expressionless face and said" This is for you Jason. Sam had asked me to give it to you when he was gone". 
                    In the letter he had said: " Dear Jason, I have kept my promise in the end to lend you my eyes if anything had happened to them. Now there is nothing more that I can ask from God, than the fact,that will see the world through my eyes. You will always be my best friend........Sam".
                    When he had finished reading Dr. Berkeley said " I had promised Sam to keep his sacrifice he made a secret from you. But now I wish I didn't stick it Because I don't think It was worthy it".

                    No matter what If we make a friend, we should stick by him till the end. Life is meaningless without a friend.

                    It was a crisp morning on June 15th,2005 when I got a call from my father, “Its a girl” he said. My joy knew no bounds and I danced around my balcony announcing the news of the new arrival to my neighbors.         
                    My elder sister, Smitha(26yrs), delivered a girl on June 15th,2005. It was such a blessing for all of us. She stayed with us through her pregnancy and it was a wonderful bonding time for us. I would take care of her sleep, food, etc and be extra cautious to her. I even decorated my room with posters showcasing ‘cute’ babies.
                    I had to go to college on the day of delivery, as I had my exam. I took my friends to canteen and everyone was surprised on this sudden treat. They actually started calling me “new mom” , as in some cultures consider the mother’s sister to be close to the baby, next to the father.
                    I was excited the whole day, eager to get to the hospital. I observed the nature; Fresh flowers bloomed that day, I found chickens with mother hen, puppies playing with each other, piglets running around and even the egg in the nest of my neighbor’s house cracked and a beautiful sparrow chick appeared! I wondered, was this the nature’s way of giving the newborn a ‘natural’ welcome?
                    It was 8pm when I saw my niece. I took her in my arms and felt the little bundle quiver. She let out a short cry and I had to calm her. I looked at her soft face, warm little hands, and her tiny feet wrapped beneath the hospital’s white towel. I marveled and gazed at the tiniest human in my hand. When I looked at her, I thought she must have come from a beauty parlor-her eyebrows looked like  a perfect symmetry and she had thick black hair! Her nails were big and I wondered was she filing them in the womb?
                    I held her for 15 minutes. I never knew her arrival would change my life. I was just 17 years of age at that time and my life was filled with ‘going to college and coming back home’. I felt that I am too young to be an aunt. I never knew that taking a new responsibility will change my perspectives on being an aunt.
                    I decorated my house for homecoming of my sister and the little one. It was from then on that I embraced my new role. I was overly cautious with my niece-putting her to sleep, checking on her from time to time, cleaning the whole house floor with ‘Dettol’ and so on. Everything around was spick and span .It was time for her naming ceremony and we named her ‘Swarnika” which means “The golden one”
                    That was just the beginning. What lay ahead was a roller coaster ride. It was really a tough job to put her to sleep, any tiny amount of noise would wake her up. We tried all means to make her sleep.It was like, to don our thinking caps to find out solutions. My sister resumed her job after Swarnika was 3 months and hence I had to take care of her most of the time.
                    As she grew, I felt that we all together crossed a milestone with her. Her first crawl, her first baby talk, her first laugh, her first attempt to sit, etc meant a lot to me. I would show her various things and teach her the names of colors, trees, animals, etc. She was 9 months old and she had been falling sick often. We suspected a new tooth must be the problem. We waited for her tooth to come, but with no results. One morning after she woke up, I took bread to give her. When i inserted my finger in her mouth with the piece of bread, she just chewed my finger and there was a sharp pain. I wondered how come she has a sharp pin on her gums? I realised that she got her first tooth!.We could see it coming out slowly after a couple of days!
                    She would sit in the balcony of our apartment and watch strangers come and go on the streets. I was returning home from college one day and she saw me and stood up on the grill base. She shouted  “SAYDA SAYDA SAYDA”. My heart just skipped a beat when she said that!. I ran home and just hugged her tightly. I felt as if all things of the past are forgiven and something new lay before me. It was like as if a curtain was removed and new light was shown. (Generally Malayalees pronounce my name as “Sayda” instead of “Swetha”. the “t” sound is substituted by the ‘da’ sound)
                    I became close to her even more. I was her playmate and rhyme teacher. She would come behind me everywhere I went. It feels good to pick her up, carry her around, play with her and also cuddle her. I would sing to her when she would sleep and when I stopped, she would get up and tell me to sing again
                    As I sit back and think, I realized that the birth of my niece saw a new person in me. My thinking completely changed from self-centered to thinking for others, I started admiring nature more and also my heart opened the door of outpouring of love and care. My friends speak to me more openly because they trust me that I completely understand. I always placed others first before thinking about myself. Well, go shopping and first thing I buy is for my niece!
                    People may ask a father or a mother or a grandfather or a grandmother on how the arrival of a baby changes their lives, but rarely an aunt. Well, let me tell you, the outcome of being an aunt result in more love, care, and unexpected adventures. Above all, you realize that God sends His wonderful creation to bring out a new person in you.

                    Her eyes filled up with tears and she tried to escape. When she was running back I said
                    “He took advantage of you, I’m not going to lie. He tricked you, he hurt you, because he knew he could. You were an easy target.”
                    She then smiled, looking into my eyes.
                    “But, he made you strong. He broke you, I know. But you have to learn how to glue those broken pieces back together. Nobody can do that but you. So, you may regret him hurting you, but I don’t. He made you strong. And one day, you’ll realize that because of him, you’re a better person sister”
                    That was the first time being a brother I helped my sister to move on.
                    Girls don’t be afraid of sharing your pain to your brothers because they can feel you. And boys if your sister is trying to share you something listen to her and motivate her, don’t mistreat her because of her bad choice. In your life, you have also done the same somewhere. Siblings bonding are most effective, your sister doesn’t need another person to get her to move on, because of next time what if she is a victim of another boy.
                    Make your sister feel “Its okay to have a heartbreak it can be mended”. Make her feel you are the superhero and she is the superwoman.

                    Love is a crazy thing in the world.

                    I’m so excited and so happy because within few minutes my dear loving sis Sanjana is going to change from Miss to Mrs. Yeah today is my sister’s wedding and now I’m in the marriage hall with heart full of happiness. So happily I’m watching my sis on the stage, sitting next to her fiancée, wearing a beautiful silk sari. She looks gorgeous in that bridal wear. She is doing all the customs and rituals told by priest. It feels too good to see her doing all that, and silently I prayed in my heart for her future. I could see the mixed reaction in her face she was happy, tensed, sometimes blushing too.
                    My name is Krithika and for the readers information Sanjana is not my own sis. She is my colleague at work place. As I was looking at her, I was lost in my sweet memories. Life is full of surprises that we never know when we will meet someone really special in our life. Sanjana is really a special person in my life. I can say that she is one of god’s gifts who made my life so meaningful and colorful.
                    Just one year back I met her at my work place. That time I didn’t know anything about her. We came to know each other during our office time which made us little closer and gradually we became good friends too. As days passed the bond between us become so strong and soon we started to share a sisterly love to each other, especially me. We were not from the same womb, not from the same blood but I felt she is my sis forever.
                    “A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit and a golden thread to the meaning of life.”
                    How true these lines are! I liked her presence, so I started spending a lot of time with her and I loved her a lot. Always I used to find reasons and time to be with her. I felt that she is mine and I can do anything for her. This may be very silly to others but it’s really a very special feeling to me. 
                    I don’t have any brothers or sisters. Not even cousins. So badly I was longing for some love and affection. When she came into my life that’s it I could feel and sense her sisterly sis care and affection on me. She is very caring, loving, kind and compassionate. I liked her in all that she did for me which makes me so crazy day by day. She showed motherly love towards me. She advised me like a dad. She gave me company whenever I was alone, just like a friend. She cared for me like a sis. She paved me a new path in my life when I was depressed because of few personal reasons.
                    And one thing which I wanted to tell about her is that, she is not at all expressive. But I’ll always express my love in form of surprise gifts, fighting with her, advising her not to do certain things and sudden visits. But she would never express anything. I hope she too like me. Even if she misses me, she won’t tell. Even if she wanted to tell me something, she won’t tell. I have to get words from her mouth. Then too it’s very difficult. Huff… But I know how much she loves me and cares for me. She wants me to be happy forever and she wants me to reach greater heights in my life.

                    She will scold me if I did anything wrong,

                    She will teach me to do the right things,

                    She will guide me through the right path,

                    She will motivate me during my bad times,

                    She will pray for me and for my future,

                    She will tell that I’m too stupid, but likes that a lot,

                    And finally she will love me, even if I do any mistake.

                    Suddenly the loud music of nathaswaram brings me to reality. And there the groom ties the mangal sutra around my sis’s neck. I feel so happy for her. Let her life be filled with joy and peace forever. The newly married couple started receiving the blessings from the elders, gifts from the friends; some people were teasing the couple. I was watching everything silently. Suddenly I felt like somewhat, I felt that I lost something very precious I don’t know to express what I felt exactly but I felt the pain of losing someone. The kind of feel that I have experienced once in my life. I searched for my sis to tell her that I’m not in a good mood. Something has happened to me. But she was not there beside me. She is there in the stage with the important person of her life.
                    I felt the lump in my throat. She is no more my sis. She has some one in her life who is so special and with whom she is going to spend her entire life. Hereafter I can’t meet her whenever I want coz she may have so many responsibilities and I have to wait for the moment. I can’t spend the entire day with her. I can’t go out frequently with her. I can’t text or chat or talk with her continuously. I can’t spend the whole day with her on her birthday and I can’t give any surprises to her.
                    She looked at me and asked me to come to the stage, I went up hugged her tightly conveyed my heartiest wishes and gave my gift to her. I was happy, but at the same time I felt sad too. I don’t know to express what type of feel was that. Again I looked at both of them, wished them and started moving towards the entrance of the hall. I almost reached the gate. I turned back and saw my sis. She too looked at me and smiled. For The First Time I felt that she is not mine and she will never be mine hereafter. Immediately, I turned back to hide my tears. I wiped of my tears and smiled at her and gestured a bye to her. It is really difficult to behave different with the person whom we loved so much. As I walked I was thinking how I’m going to behave with her from now onwards, but I understood… This is life and we have to move on. Whatever happens she will be my sis and I will be there for her always.

                    I just never knew you would turn out to be so much harmful; else, never I must have bothered to you. A friend would never do something like what you did. I indeed feel unenviable to recollect the fact that we were friends.

                    I remember when I first met you. It was quite a sunny day, and our first day at college. Students of the new batch were to assemble in the main hall. It was the first time when I caught a glimpse of you. You were in your red shorts and a plain black t-shirt, with a ponytail and you looked very fine. Some boys even wanted to talk to you. I purposely stood next to you. I genuinely thought you might be a generous girl with a firm attitude. Our college principal began his speech to his New Year students and we stood straight.


                    
                    Suddenly a choking voice of the microphone came out of the speakers in a very harsh voice, some of the students started laughing about it, and you were one of them. You shouted and howled like a guy, and it was outrageous to see a girl doing such stuff. You suddenly turned to me and laughed, expecting that I too must laugh on this, but I just smiled at you gladly. I was very happy to get your attention, but your behavior wasn’t comforting. I desperately needed a friend in the new college, new town and most importantly a new life after school.

                    We were to move back to the mess for the food. I again purposely sat next to you, hoping to have a conversation. You took my presence and began talking to me. Really, you were too amiable to me. You did not let me feel that was our first conversation, especially the way you hit me on my back repeatedly, just as if how usually boys do! I learnt you love sports, and basketball was your game. Well, it was too obvious to know, you were a tomb boy. But whatever you were, I was happy to have a good-looking sport-loving girl as my friend. We exchanged our numbers and came in contact. You lived in the college residence but I lived with my relatives in the town.


                    
                    Then we kept on meeting very often. Gradually, we went on being good friends. Nevertheless, you made me feel deplorable sometimes the way you dealt with others. You often cracked jokes on others, badgered and annoyed our classmates with your irritating tricks and abused girly girls for the way they dressed themselves. Sometimes, you did not spare even me with your endurable spirit of teasing. People asked me huge times to remain away from you. They all had come to know we didn’t share any single quality and that I was just being nice to you. Unfortunately, their perception was true. Many a times I felt like I should quit your friendship, but one thought always stopped me to proceed, as you were the only friend of mine, who was so popular, handsome and undeniably, my first friend in the college. But it was becoming too harder to remain friends with you.

                    After a lot of patience, I decided to get separated from your friendship. I started ignoring you a bit, like if you appeared in my sight, I pretended as if I have not seen you. But I guess you caught me. You soon understood my ignorance. You came to me and directly asked me if there was anything wrong. This one single thing was only appreciating, that you were always straight in your talks. You never tangled the confusions or talked indirectly, which I definitely lacked. I then settled things by providing lame explanations. Somehow you accepted and never bothered about my ignorance as you were too much busy with your sports.


                    
                    Our first year came near to end. You won us the inter college basketball championship, as the captain. Principal and every one appreciated for your efforts. Really, we all were proud of you. Unluckily our exams were just one month after. You did not study the entire year and were always engaged in your basketball shots and strategies. You were horrified to see such lny syllabus and were all confused. You asked me to help you in studies. I agreed. However, I just did not know you thought me a fool. You wanted me to complete all your assignments and projects. I somehow did. You wanted me to teach you like a tutor, fill your mind with everything given in our textbooks. I agreed to explain you though, but you were not satisfied with whatever I taught you. You treated me very gratingly as if I owed a lot to you. I did every possible thing for you to get ready for exams, but still you were not gratified. You wanted more out of me; you wanted me to give more and more time to you. But I had to study for my exams too.I tried to tell you indirectly that I can’t do anything more than this, but I guess you did not want to understand my problems.


                    
                    I was extremely chafed by your behavior. I then decided to completely dismiss, no matter what. I began ignoring your calls and messages. I switched off my cell phone. You were annoyed by this attitude of mine and got impatient. You visited me at my place un-announced, and burst in anger. You capper clawed, yelled and abused me as if I did a crime by not giving attention to you. As soon as you left, I uttered a great cry and kept on weeping that whole night.

                    We were not friends anymore. I decided never to talk to you, so did you. After that day, we often saw each other; but we turned our heads in other directions each time. Nevertheless, I’m just not hesitant to tell you, that now I actually love life without you. Moreover, I need you to know, that Friend, you are not tolerable!

                    Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                    The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...

                    At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                    One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                    "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                    So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                    The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                    However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                    Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                    Once upon a time there was a zombie called Patizombi, who was fed up with being the villain in everyone’s stories. So, to prove that he could do good, he decided to go hunting evil ghosts.

                    But ghosts aren’t very visible and they’re sneaky too. It was only after many failed attempts that Patizombi spotted a confused ghost floating through the forest. He approached it carefully, set out his traps and jumped on him.

                    The battle was going very badly until Patizombi realized that he was in fact not fighting a ghost but a clingy bedsheet he’d been trapped by.

                    “Ha, ha, ha! You have fallen right into my trap, you evil zombie!” A ghost laughed, emerging from his hiding spot.

                    “Ahh, evil ghost,” Patizombi replied. “I’ll catch you one day.”

                    “No, no, no, no and no!” said the ghost, incredibly offended. “Excuse me, but I am a good ghost and my job is to hunt evil zombies.

                    “Oh no you don’t!” objected Patizombi, “because I am a good zombie, and I am the one who hunts evil ghosts.”

                    After arguing for a little while, they realised they were both telling the truth. They found it funny and became friends.

                    “I suppose not all ghosts are evil…”

                    “Nor all zombies…”

                    “We could join forces to hunt ogres”

                    And they headed as a team into the mountains, where the most fearsome ogres were hidden. Working quickly together, they found the track of an ogre that led them to a cave. As the ogre was out, they prepared a trap but while they were doing so a giant stone fell and blocked the entrance leaving them trapped.

                    “Ha, ha, ha! it was so easy to trap that evil zombie and his ghostie partner!”

                    “Lies!” they protested from inside, “We are not evil. The only evil one is you and we have come to catch you!”

                    Once again, the discussion carried on until everyone was persuaded that none of them was evil.

                    “We would never have thought that good ogres existed”

                    “Neither would I have thought that a zombie and a ghost were not evil”

                    It is obvious that, before you set out to hunt anyone, you need to make sure that they are evil...

                    That is how they discovered that, even if a creature has a reputation for being evil, it is not always true. And this is also true for all other creatures who have a reputation for being dirty, noisy or annoying: you can never tell which ones are actually like that without first getting to know them. That is how they found many more zombies, ghosts and good ogres who joined their group of catchers of evil creatures. Everyone trusted this valley police force, which never allowed anyone to be treated badly due to prejudice and to bad reputations they did not deserve.

                    There was once a fairy who was learning how to be a fairy godmother. Most magic and wonderful, she was the kindest and cleverest of all fairies. However, she was also a very ugly fairy. And no matter how much she showed her wonderful qualities, it seemed that everyone was determined to believe that the most important thing about a fairy was her beauty. In the fairy school they ignored her, and every time she flew off on a mission to help a child or anyone else in trouble, before she could say a word they were already screeching and yelling at her: "Ugly! Get out of here, weirdo!"

                    Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful. But then she remembered what her mother had always told her: "My dear, you are what you are, warts and all; and never doubt that you are this way for a very special reason..."

                    But then, one day, the witches of the neighbouring land invaded and destroyed the country, putting all the fairies and wizards in prison. Our fairy, just before being attacked, put a spell on her own clothes and, helped by her ugly face, she managed to pass for a witch. That way she was able to follow the witches back to their den.

                    Once there she used her magic to prepare a big party for everyone, decorating the cave with bats, toads and spiders. The music was provided by a pack of howling wolves. While the party was in full swing, the fairy hurried off and set free all the fairies and wizards who had been imprisoned. When all of them were free, they worked together on one big spell which succeeded in trapping the witches inside the mountain for the next hundred years. And for the next hundred years, and more, everyone remembered the great bravery and intelligence of the ugly fairy.

                    And from that day on no one in that land ever saw ugliness as a disgrace. Whenever someone ugly was born, people were filled with joy, knowing that for that new person great things lay ahead.

                    Mr. Horsefly was the new head of the prairie post office. He had put a lot of time and effort into getting this highly respected position; he had even moved fields. If you asked Mr. Horsefly, he would tell you that he got the job thanks to his great deductive gifts.

                    On his first day at work, he opened up shop, and into the post office came Mr. Beetle, Mrs Spider, Miss Mantis, and Mr. Grasshopper.
                    Mr. Horsefly wouldn't let them so much as open their mouths.

                    "Don't tell me, don't tell me. I bet I can work out what each of you came for," he said, putting a book, a plastic mat, a nail file, and some protective goggles on the counter.

                    "The nail file will be for Mrs. Spider, without a doubt. With all the scratching she does, she'll need to put her nails right. “The mat”, he went on, without giving anyone time to react, "without even having to think about it, I give it to Mr. Grasshopper, since he must have to train pretty hard to keep all his hopping about up to a decent standard. The safety goggles have to be for Mr. Beetle, because having to spend all day with his face so close to the ground, he'll be needing something to protect his eyes. And finally, this big book here, has to be a Bible. I'll have to give that to Miss Praying Mantis, whom I would like to ask to include me in her supplications to The Almighty. As you will see..."

                    They didn't let him finish. The comment about the mantis - well known on the prairie for having changed her name from Miss Praying Mantis to simply Miss Mantis - was just too much for everyone, and they burst out laughing...

                    "Not much of a detective, are you!" said Mr. Grasshopper, between chuckles. "For a start, Mrs. Spider came for the book. She's very quiet, and doesn't scratch a soul.

Just a few days later, after having met all the insects in person, Mr. Horsefly had a good laugh while telling this story about his deductions made from prejudice without yet having met a soul. And he understood that judging without knowing is a practice for fools.

                    XT-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read "XT-27: The best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other XT-27s.

                    "All robots should be like us XT-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the XT-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself.

                    One day, he was walking along in Bionic City, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors (that's eyes to you and me, but XT-27 liked to use highly technical sounding words for everything).

                    He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an XT-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were XT-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing!

                    Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an XT-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble (a house), on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were XT-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more.
                    On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time.

                    So XT-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun TP-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another XT-27.
                    So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push...
                    When he woke up, the XT-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The XT-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The XT-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "XT-28, the best, most modern robot".
                    So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The XT-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn't feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points.

                    There was once a boy who was afraid of the dark. He thought that when it was dark his bedroom filled up with monsters. But there came a time when he was too old to be allowed to keep sleeping with the light on.

                    That first night he was paralysed with fear, his mind full of monsters. So much so, that he went over to his wardrobe to get a torch. But when he opened the wardrobe door he came face to face with a monster, and he let out the loudest scream in the world.

                    The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and... started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there.

                    The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair.

                    The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons... It was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends.

                    And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.

                    Once upon a time, there was a gang of evil goblins who lived in a forest. They spent a lot of their time making fun of a poor old man who could now hardly move, see, or hear. They showed no respect for his age.

                    The situation became so extreme that the Great Wizard decided to teach the goblins a lesson. He cast a spell, and from that moment, every insult they directed at the old man made the old man better, but had the opposite effect on the goblin who was doing the insulting. Of course, the goblins knew nothing about what was happening. The more they called the man an "old fool", the younger and sharper of mind he became, while the goblin who had shouted at him aged rapidly, and became a little more foolish.

                    As time went on, those evil goblins were becoming terribly old, ugly, stupid, and clumsy... without even realising it. Finally, the Great Wizard allowed the goblins to see themselves, and, terrified, they saw that they had turned into the disgusting creatures we now know as trolls.

                    They had been so busy picking on the old man, that it had made them incapable of noticing that their own acts were turning them into monsters. And when they finally realised what they had done, it was too late.

                    Reggie couldn't hear a thing. He was a normal boy, but he had been born deaf. He was well known to everyone in town, and they were all very fond of him. Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby.

                    Reggie didn't like this very much. But the person who disliked it the most was his friend Michael, who decided one day that things had to change. Michael's father was the town´s Mayor, and Michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of Reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs.

                    People liked the idea, because everyone loved Reggie. The day became known as The Day of Silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: Reggie was amazing!

                    On that day no one was thinking of Reggie as just a deaf person. This meant he could be treated just like any other little boy; and people saw a whole new side of him. Not only that, but Reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, Reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all Reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference.

                    So the Day of Silence was the day Reggie´s true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head. A helmet with great thick ear flaps; a helmet which meant you couldn't hear the slightest thing.

                    Pete Sparks was a sensitive boy. So sensitive that even his hair was ticklish. You only had to touch his hair a little bit and he would burst out laughing. And when this ticklish laughter started, no one could make him stop.

                    So Pete grew up used to strange situations. When his granny’s friends came to visit, he would always end up in stitches because there was never any shortage of little old ladies rubbing his head and saying “How cute!”

                    Windy days were the worst, with Pete on the ground, paralyzed by laughter whenever the breeze blew on his locks, which, incidentally, were pretty long because at the barber shop no one could manage to cut his hair, due to the non-stop giggling. To see Pete laugh, as well as being great fun, was terribly contagious. When Pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing.

                    As Pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places. Some activities are serious business, and cannot be done amid gales of laughter. So Pete tried everything to control his ticklishness: he tried wearing a thousand different hats, he used ultra strong hairsprays and gels, he shaved his head, and he even went on a yoga course to see if he could bear the tickling by learning to relax himself.

                    But nothing worked; it was impossible. He wanted, with all his heart, to just be a normal boy. So, as time went on, he began to feel sad and ill-fated for being different.
                    This went on until, one day in the street, he met a special clown. The clown was very old and could hardly walk, but when he saw Pete in tears, he went to cheer him up. It didn’t take long to make Pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown.

                    “I have no one to replace me”, said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do”. Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought “serious? A clown?”, trying to understand what the old man had told him.

                    “Come, I’ll show you” said the clown.

                    So the clown took Pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show Pete’s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter.

                    When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at Pete and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age”.

                    “It’s true,” answered Pete, smiling and returning the wink, “not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. And that’s so hard to find”. This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter.

                    And that is how Pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that Pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.

                    The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha, The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.

                    After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.

                    Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.

                    What did Buddha emphasize here? He said, It is effortless. Having 'peace of mind' is not a strenuous job; it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment, such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.

The Wizard destroyed all big trees. Then humans made knives and swords of metal. He destroyed all metal on the planet. People made sling and began to throw stones at each other. It was necessary to destroy the stones, too. And then peacekeepers began to worry: all trees have disappeared; there is no metal and stones. How to live, what to eat now? There will be no vegetation soon, and people will die without even fighting. No, this is a wrong solution of the problem.

                    The Wizard became confused:

                    – I do not know how to behave now. I would have destroyed all humanity, but, unfortunately, it is not in my power!

                    The peacekeepers fell into despair; they did not know what to do. And then one clever kid turned to the Wizard.

                    – I know what you should do. Let people feel, how others perceive their actions. If one person hurt someone, let him feel the same pain, and if he brings joy to someone, let him feel the same joy. So no one will hurt each other, because he will feel the pain immediately too and would have to stop.

                    All people were inspired with the greatness of kid’s thought, and the wizard realized his idea. He returned all trees, stones and metals.

                    Since that day nobody on the planet tried to hurt his neighbour, because he would have to feel the same pain too. People began to help each other, because they liked the sense of joy they felt at this moment. And they began to live in harmony and joy.

                    Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great King, and for as long as anyone could remember, the King spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this King and the King of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war.

                    The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds...
                    
                    At this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them "I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".

                    One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?"

                    "Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing", said the King's sword. "If we make enough noise no one will sleep."

                    So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest.

                    The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the Kings or the Generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day.

                    However, the weapons, led by the King's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the Kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories.

                    Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the Kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as Kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.

                    A heart touching STORY - PEACE!! :)

                    A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block.
                    He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did U take all this time to come? Don’t U know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t U have any sense of responsibility?”
                    Th…e doctor smiled & said:”I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call…… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work”
                    “Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would U calm down? If your own son dies now what will U do??” said the father angrily.
                    The doctor smiled again & replied: “I will say what Job said in the Holy Book “From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God”. Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go & intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace”
                    “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father.
                    The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,“Thank goodness!, your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply he carried on his way running. “If U have any question, ask the nurse!!”
                    “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.
                    The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.”
                    The patient father remained speechless.

                    There was a monk who lived on the edge of a small town, much to the delight of the townspeople. Whenever he ventured into town to help someone, everyone came out of their homes to give him gifts from their gardens, calling out to him, "Oh, Teacher, we're so fortunate to have you living nearby! You are such a wonderful person! You do so much good, Teacher! Your presence is such a blessing!"

                    To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                    One day a young woman came to the monk's hut and said, "Oh, Teacher, I'm in terrible trouble. I'm pregnant and my family will disown me. The young man who I love so much has fled to another town because my family would certainly do him harm. I have nowhere else to turn and no one else to ask for help."

                    The monk replied that she could live in the back room and help around the house and she would then have the security of a home for her child.

                    Well, now when the monk went into town, he was reviled. "You dirty old man! Look how you have betrayed our trust and taken advantage of that young woman! How could we have ever believed in you? What shame you have brought on us!" And they hurled rotten fruit at him along with their insults.

                    To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                    After a while, the father of the child returned to the town and presented himself before the family, saying, "I have spent the past two years learning a trade in a neighboring town and now I am able to provide a home for your daughter and grandchild." The family was overjoyed. Although it wasn't the best of situations, it was so much better than they had feared that they welcomed their daughter and grandchild back into the family with open arms.

                    How different it was when the monk came into town then. The townspeople lined the road every time, presenting him with gifts of food and calling out, "Oh, Teacher, how could we have ever doubted you? Look at the wonderful thing you have done! We are so ashamed! Please forgive us! You are such a wise and compassionate person! We are so fortunate to have you living nearby!"

                    To all of this, the monk would always reply, "Is that so? Is that so?"

                    While there is no single interpretation that would do justice to this story, it certainly speaks to the equanimity of the monk. Against the backdrop of praise and condemnation, he holds himself apart from "what everyone thinks" even as he acts with the most compassionate and involved sense of responsibility. Whether in public or the workplace or in the privacy of home life, people will misread our intentions and jump to conclusions that cast us in a bad light. The most straight-forward lesson of this story, then, is that by continuing on the most ethical course of action our true intents become known. This, however, can be a short-lived vindication as the same thing may happen all over again: We ought not be pulled off-center by shallow praise any more than by shallow criticism.

                    The monk in this story serves as a model by maintaining emotional detachment from the transient opinions of others while never withdrawing from personal involvement with others' real needs

                    A woman whose husband died unexpectedly faced dire circumstances. Creditors hounded her, taking everything away from her and her young son. Fearing she might lose the most valuable possession of the family, she hid the priceless jewel that had been handed down for generations by sowing it into the sleeve of an old coat that the creditors would never want. The troubles weighed on her grief and eventually broke her spirit and she died without ever telling her son about the jewel.

                    The boy found himself without family or home, his only inheritance the old threadbare coat that the creditors left him. He found work wherever he could, staying in barns or out in the forest, exposed to the elements and grave hardship. Filled with sorrow at his fate, he endured the passing years with an abiding belief in the unfairness of life.

                    One day, as he was chopping wood, his sleeve caught on a branch and tore open. Out spilled the priceless jewel onto the ground before him!

                    The source of happiness -- real wealth -- is our birthright, something we carry with us from childhood whether we remember it or not. We are rich, the story says, even when we feel deprived. This is because, of course, the jewel represents the perfect nature of the true, original self with which we are born. Upon finding the jewel, the young man realized he had been rich all along -- and his life changed irreversibly in just that single moment of recognizing the jewel.

                    Becoming more aware of the hidden jewel we carry at all times brings us in touch with the source of inner peace and happiness. The more we identify with our hidden treasure, the more we become a well of peace and happiness overflowing into the lives of others.

                    A wandering monk passed by the courtyard of a monastery where he heard two groups of monks arguing about the temple flag fluttering in the breeze.

                    "It is the flag that moves," one group argued.

                    "No, it is the wind that moves," argued the other group.

                    Back and forth they argued, responding to the logic of the other side, coming up with new rationale for their respective positions. But it just came down to, "It is the wind that moves, it is the flag that moves."

                    After listening for a while, the itinerant monk interrupted them and said, "If you look more closely you will see that it is neither the flag nor the wind that moves -- what moves is your mind."

                    This story is a reminder of how easily we fall into "either-or" thinking. It doesn't matter what the subject is, we are fully capable of taking sides and then feeling the need to prove ourselves "right." The lesson of "seeing ourselves seeing" is a necessary one if we are to develop the witness awareness that watches habit thoughts and feelings arise automatically. Interrupting ingrained reactions to things allows us to consciously create new reactions that better reflect our current stage of development.

                    n Ayodhya, there was a beautiful white pigeon. A very special kind. That beautiful white pigeon could fly high in the blue sky up from one tree to another tree, from one rooftop to another. Her wings made sounds like Phad... Phad… Phad... and she never seemed to mind because she had faith in her own capacities gifted by God… on her powerful wings!

                    The pigeon lived in her nest made on Noore Allah Masjid, made with straws & threads collected from St. Mary’s Church near the Gurudwara.

                    The pigeon flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir, and then she flew right back again. Birds have no religions, then why we humans?

                    One sad day, when the pigeon flew out, it started to rain. Although she flew with all her might, she couldn’t get home again. She beat her wings against the rain, but they got wet and slowly some feathers drooped from her wings, and shewas injured due to this.

                    The pigeon tried her best to fly. But she knew that she was “pooped.”

                    A kind 7-year-old girl, Krishna, was watching that troubled pigeon. Krishna was enjoying a bath in the rain that time.

                    Krishna saw the poor pigeon fall into her garden. Krishna felt that in that situation her duty was quite simple. She took that tiny frail bird and kept her warm and dry. She gave her water so she could drink, some food to eat and told her, “Not to cry... you will be o.k. soon Mashkalli!”

                    Krishna named the pigeon “Mashkalli” because of Mashkalli’s beautiful white colour and eyes like diamonds. Krishna told Mashkalli, “You look like a “Shantidoot… Messenger of Peace & love!”

                    Krishna cared for Mashkalli for fifteen days, until Mashkalli became quite strong. Krishna took Mashkalli everywhere she went, to school, to work, and to play. They grew very close during this period.

                    One day Krishna watched Mashkalli fearfully. Krishna knew Mashkalli wouldn’t be there long.

                    “Please, mummy, may I keep this bird Mashkalli? Now Mashkalli loves me and I love her. We are friends; I just can’t let him go.” Krishna’s voice was sad and low when she requested her mother.

                    Krishna’s mother spoke softly and gently. She knew just what to say, “Look Krishna! Mashkalli’s home is somewhere else. Mashkalli’ must soon fly away... our garden has been a resting place for her, just like a small hotel or hospital. Krishna, it is nice of you that you took care of your bird friend Mashkalli. In her troubled time. However, this does not mean that you can keep her in any cage. If you really love someone, let us free them! If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly come back to you someday…!”

                    Yes, what Krishna’s mother said was very true. It happened the next day. Mashkalli circled overhead, and then she flew away, as Krishna watched.

                    Krishna felt a little sad for a few days because she was missing Mashkalli a lot. However, Krishna had full faith in her mother’s words. “If you really love someone you have to free them. If they love you, and deserve you, they will certainly comeback to you someday…!”

                    Now Mashkalli was rather home again. She was feeling very happy. Mashkalli again started to flew from Noore Allah Masjid to Ram Mandir.

                    Now, “The Messenger of Peace & love: Shantidoot Mashkalli” takes a little longer flight. Mashkalli always stops at Krishna’s garden to tell her friend hello, pay thanks, and play with her every morning.

                    If this, an uneducated bird can pay thanks to her helper, why not we, so called educated humans…?”

                    In the rising sun’s light of hope, little Krishna was thinking this, and Shantidoot Mashkalli was eating food from Krishna’s little, soft palm, sitting on her hand. Krishna’s mother was watching that special friendship of an innocent human and an innocent bird. She smiled.

                    REALLY LOVE SOMEONE? FREE THEM…

                    A man woke up in the middle of a dirt road. Half of his face had brown dirt covering it, and his hair was a mess. His shirt was ragged, and he had lost a shoe. His vision was all blurry, and he was squinting in the sunlight, struggling to make use of his eyes. He could see a few hazy trees in the distance, beyond the expanse of dry, yellow land and grass. He had been in an accident. He had fallen from his buggy, banged his head, and had forgotten everything about himself. He had woken up with absolutely no memory of anything whatsoever. He knew he should have some memories, but he could locate none. He became very afraid. Who was he? How had he got here?

                    As his vision continued to adjust to his surroundings, he saw a pile of papers on the ground, and a little red booklet resting on the top of them, just a few meters from where he was. He had not noticed, however, that a few meters to the left of this pile of information, was a lion.

                    The lion walked gently in front of the papers, creating a barrier between them and the man. Then the lion sat down on his hindquarters, and looked at the man in the eyes.

                    The man did not move. He was well aware that it was a lion now.

                    "I saw what happened," said the lion, seeing that the man had no idea.

                    "You were driving too fast in that thing," the lion nodded towards the buggy further down the dirt road, which was tipped over on its side. "And you fell out. These papers have all your information on them, your name, address – all of your details."

                    The man felt like he was frozen to the warm earth beneath him.

                    "Oh, and don't worry," added the lion, forgetting how things may have appeared to the man "...I'm not particularly hungry."

                    "May I have the papers?" asked the man, wishing to get away with his details as quickly as possible.

                    "Yes, of course," said the lion, standing up and ready to remove the blockade he had created.

                    "Oh, thank you," said the man, relieved, "I don’t even remember who I am!"

                    At this the lion stopped. He sat back down. This was too good to spoil. A man who had no ideas about himself? No psychological baggage at all? No identity to speak of? Oh, how wonderful...

                    "Ah, amnesia of the self," said the lion, feeling refreshed. "Beautiful."

                    "What do you mean beautiful?" asked the man impatiently, "I need my identity back! I mean...who am I? I know nothing of my past, not even my own name! Please!" he begged, "The papers!"

                    "Listen to yourself panicking like this," the lion chuckled. "This is quite silly."

                    "But I have absolutely no identity!" cried out the man, pleading for this lion to give him some information about himself.

                    "I will give you these papers," said the lion, "but I want you to look at something. At the moment you know nothing about yourself, but you do not deny your own existence. You are begging me to give you your name and personal history, because without these stories you feel you are nothing, no one – that you don’t exist without your identity. But you are still here. Do not confuse your name, history and occupation with who you are. You exist, no matter what your story, what your name. If you were not so desperate for labels and definitions to create an identity for yourself, you would feel so free, so happy, so at one with this creation. Can you not just be comfortable having no definitions for a moment, and really be aware of what you truly are?

                    "This is a blessing in disguise,” added the lion.

                    This man felt he could not argue with the lion anymore, so he followed his orders. Who was he? This was what he was trying to find out through the information on those papers. But the lion was right, at the moment this man had no ideas about himself, yet somehow, his existence was being fully felt. His existence was present, but now it was no longer connected to any ideas. His existence was not limited to any particular form, it was everywhere, making up everything.

                    The lion was now standing, looking at the man, with dark, deep eyes. As the man looked back at the lion, he felt like whatever was looking out of the lion's eyes, was not separate from what was looking out of his own.

                    "Now you can have the papers." The lion pushed them with its paw towards the man, and they made a scraping noise on the ground. The man crouched down, picked them up, but now was not so eager to give himself a description. He figured these papers would be useful so he could find his house, get his bearings, but he didn’t need them to know who he was just yet. He placed them in his back pocket, and skipped off towards the hut he could now see in the distance, completely free of the ideas about himself he previously had.

                    “It took me a second to really realize what was happening. When I opened the bedroom door and it was full of smoke, it took me a minute to grasp that this was a serious house fire,” Stone said.

                    She sprang into action and got her five kids, her father-in-law and her pets out of the house before the whole structure burned.

                    “He says I’m a hero,” Stone said of her fiancé, “But I don’t think I’m a hero, I’m just a mom who got my kids out safely—nothing means more to me than them.”

                    There abode in Thessaly, in the days of Hercules, a strange race of men who had the head and arms of a man together with the body of a horse. They were called Centaurs, or Bull-Slayers.

                    One of them named Cheiron, famous for his knowledge of medicine, music and botany, had been the teacher of Hercules. But many of them, although learned, were not good. Hercules and Theseus had waged war on them and had killed many, so that their numbers were greatly lessened.

                    Having married Deianira, the daughter of a powerful King of Calydon, in Greece, Hercules was traveling home with her when he came to the banks of a river and was at a loss how to cross it. Seeing his perplexity, Nessus, one of the Centaurs, offered to take Deianira on his back and carry her over the stream. This offer Hercules gladly accepted.

                    No sooner, however, did the crafty Centaur obtain possession of Deianira than he made off with her, intending to have her as his own wife. You can easily imagine how angry this outrage made Hercules. He shot one of his poisoned arrows with so much force that it went right through the traitor Centaur, and wounded him even unto death.

                    But, before dying, Nessus had time to tell Deianira that if she wanted to keep Hercules always true to her she had but to take his shirt, and, when her husband's love was waning, prevail on him to wear it.

                    Deianira took the shirt, and shortly afterwards, being afraid that her husband was ceasing to love her, she sent it to him as a present.

                    Now, you will remember that Hercules had shot through the shirt of Nessus one of his poisoned arrows, and you will not be surprised to hear that some of the poison had remained in the shirt. So when Hercules put it on, which he did immediately upon receiving it, he was seized with frenzy and, in his madness, he uttered terrible cries and did dreadful deeds.

                    With his powerful hands he broke off huge pieces of rock, tore up pine-trees by their roots and hurled them with resounding din into the valley.

                    He could not take off the fatal shirt, and as he tore off portions of it he tore, at the same time, his quivering flesh.

                    The servant of Deianira who had carried him the fatal shirt, and who wished to solace him in his pain, he seized as she approached him and flung headlong into the sea, where she was changed into a rock that long, so runs the legend, kept its human form.

                    But at ln the majesty and the courage of the hero asserted themselves, and, although still in agony, his madness left him.

                    Calling to his side his friend Philoctetes, he wished to embrace him once more before dying; but fearful lest he should, in so doing, infect his friend with the deadly poison that was consuming him, he cried in his agony: "Alas, I am not even permitted to embrace thee!"

                    Then he gathered together the trees he had uprooted and made a huge funeral pyre, such as was used by the ancients in burning their dead. Climbing to the top of the heap, he spread out the skin of the Nemean lion, and, supporting himself upon his club, gave the signal for Philoctetes to kindle the fire that was to reduce him to ashes.

                    In return for this service he gave Philoctetes a quiver full of those deadly arrows that had been dipped in the blood of the Hydra of Lerna.

                    He further enjoined his friend to let no man know of his departure from life, to the intent that the fear of his approach might prevent fresh monsters and new robbers from ravaging the earth.

                    Thus died Hercules, and after his death he was received as a god amongst the Immortals on Mount Olympus, where he married Hebe, Jove's cupbearer. In his honor mortals were commanded to build altars and to raise temples.

                    The county recreation center swimming pool where one gets such badges presents very different conditions to those created when a June storm dumped six inches of rain over Columbia in Missouri with little warning—causing floodwaters from creeks to burst their banks, causing overflow zones to turn into ponds.

                    When 15-year-old Dominic Viet and 16-year-old Joseph Diener passed a basketball court that had turned essentially into a water polo area, they heard the frantic shouting of a young woman desperately trying to keep her head above water under the force of a current.

                    The boys had seen the girl swimming with a friend there before, but it was now obvious she was drowning.

                    “The first thing that came into my mind was to get into the water,” Dominic told CNN. “We didn’t have time to think, her head was barely above the water and we could see her sinking more down every second. We didn’t think about the risks, we had to get her out.”

                    Heroes will do as heroes do, and hoisting her up onto their shoulders, Dom and Joseph got her ashore, where emergency services arriving at someone else’s call performed first aid and rushed her to the hospital.

                    Floodwaters are no conditions to be swimming in. There can be sewage runoff, loose chemicals, downed power lines charging the current with electricity, or physical debris such as manhole covers that have been lifted out of their sockets by the force of the water.

                    Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Jenkins described the boys’ act as heroic and brave, as did Dominic’s mom, who had been calling her son for some time before and was growing nervous.

                    She sent her husband, Dom’s father, to check on his position, but when he arrived he saw ambulances and firetrucks from the call that was meant to rescue the young woman.

                    “I thought of the worst, he’s on a bike and people weren’t paying attention and my fear was he was going to pull up and see our son on the ground,” said Mrs. Viet. “But then he saw them on their bikes heading back to their friend’s house, and I got a text from Dominic saying ‘Coming home soon, just saved a woman’s life Mom.'”

                    Oh Mom… how about you have a little faith?

                    Seventy years ago, on a frozen hilltop deep in what is now North Korea, a young First Lieutenant acted with bravery that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest honor.

                    On Friday, Ralph Puckett, Jr. was hosted at the White House where he received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. government’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.

                    Ralph’s first response was to ask, “Why all the fuss? Can’t they just mail it to me?”

                    But, after his lifetime of service to the nation, President Joe Biden said at the medal ceremony, “Rather than mail it to you, I would’ve walked it to you.”

                    Ralph’s wife of 68 years, Jeannie Puckett, was in the audience, too, as Biden described how the couple met—while the brave Army Ranger was recovering from his wounds.

                    They were married two years to the day after the battle in November, 1950, for which he was honored this week with the following citation: “For acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the commander 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company…”

                    51 of Puckett’s Rangers and 9 Korean enlisted soldiers set out in a daylight attack to take Hill 205, just 60 miles from the border with China, which drew mortar, machine gun, and small-arms fire against them. First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in their offensive.

                    To make their charge, they had to cross about half mile of frozen rice paddies under fire.

                    “Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position, with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” continued the citation.

                    When the Rangers finally reached the top of the hill, they found it abandoned, but Puckett knew the fight wasn’t nearly over.

                    “During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett.”

                    Even though Puckett’s Rangers were outnumbered almost ten to one, five attacks by a battalion-strength enemy were repulsed.

                    During the first wave, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support. Over the course of the next several hours, four more waves of assaults came.

                    “He repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole, to check the company’s perimeter and to distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers.”

                    Extraordinary selflessness above and beyond the call
                    When the enemy launched a sixth attack, two mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting “grievous wounds” in both his feet, his backside, his left arm and shoulder.

                    “Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy.

                    Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy-controlled hill.

                    First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.”

                    First Time a Foreign Leader Attended This Ceremony
                    Biden said in his remarks, “Korea is sometimes called the “Forgotten War.” But those men who were there under Lieutenant Puckett’s command — they’ll never forget his bravery. They never forget that he was right by their side throughout every minute of it.”

                    “And the people of the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the President of Korea is here for this ceremony. I doubt this has ever happened before.”

                    President Moon said, “I learned that I’m the first foreign leader to ever attend a ceremony of such kind. As President of the Republic of Korea, it is a great honor and pleasure.

                    “Colonel Puckett is a true hero of the Korean War… Without the sacrifice of veterans, including Colonel Puckett and the Eighth Army Ranger Company, freedom and democracy we enjoy today couldn’t have blossomed in Korea.”

                    “From the ashes of the Korean War, we rose, we came back. And that was thanks to the Korean War veterans who fought for Korea’s peace and freedom. And now, thanks to their support and efforts, we are enjoying prosperity. On behalf of the Korean people, I express deep gratitude and respect to them. Through the war veterans, the Korean people saw a great soul of America that marches toward freedom and peace. Their acts of gallantry, sacrifice, and friendship will forever be remembered.”

                    Puckett’s military service did not end in the Korean War. He also served in the Vietnam War, where he earned a second Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars, adding to his five Purple Hearts for injuries suffered in combat.

                    Visionaries are often accused of being a little mad. Even by their wives. Such was the case of Laungi, a resident of India’s drought-blighted Gaya district in the eastern state of Bihar.

                    Loungi Bhuiya had become increasingly distraught as more and more farmers—including four of his own sons—left Kolithwa for greener pastures. Taking a leaf from Don Quixote, Bhuiyan was determined not only to dream an impossible dream but to make that dream come true by single-handedly bringing water to his village in hopes of transforming the barren land into arable acreage.

                    Inspired by the earlier exploits of “Mountain Man” Dashrath Manjh, who, with just a hammer and chisel, spent 22 years carving a road through the mountain near the village Gehlaur from 1960 to 1982, Bhuiya set out to dig an irrigation canal by hand to the closest water source in the Bangetha Hills.

                    “I had heard about him and I thought if he can do it, why can’t I?” Bhuiya told Al Jazeera. “They all thought I was mad.”

                    “He decided to dig a canal from a natural water source in Bagetha Sahwasi forest to the village,” Village leader Vishnupat Bhokta told the Tribune of India.

                    “The villagers took their cattle generally to that source for watering, which also provided sustenance to the animals living in the forest area. Loungi knew that the water source was enough to irrigate the agricultural land of the villagers. However, it was a great challenge to bring water into the village.”

                    Despite the teasing from his family and fellow villagers, the now 70-year-old Bhuiya toiled every day to make the four-foot-wide by three-foot-deep canal a reality. It took him nearly 30 years to accomplish his goal, but now everyone is benefitting from the fruits of his decades’ long labors.

                    Bhuiya, whose reputation as a neighborhood eccentric has since been transformed into local hero, was recently rewarded for his efforts with a brand-new Mahindra tractor, which will be used to expand the canal.

                    Of course, when Quixote creator Miguel de Cervantes wrote: “When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical may be madness. To surrender dreams, this may be madness… Maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be,” he wasn’t referring to Bhuiya—but he just as well might have been.

After the game, as we were heading out, someone’s phone fell and smashed near us, and then a bunch of people started pointing up. There was a woman up there on the edge of the railing. I turned to Glenn and said, “Do you think she’s gonna jump?” He said, “Oh, boy, she’s falling as we speak."
                    It’s about a four-story drop from where she fell, and — without thinking — I just put my arms out as she came toward me. Listen, I was in the Marines, and even though that was 40-some years ago, I still think like a Marine; fortunately, I still react like one once in a while. She leveled out flat as she hit my arms, and bounced off me and fell about four feet away. I fell to the ground, too, from the impact, and I blacked out for a minute. When I came to, Glenn was holding up fingers and saying, “How many do you see?” I was OK. The woman was alive but was in a coma for a while and had brain surgery. She later told me she was very grateful — they call her Miracle Girl. But what bothered me was that I didn’t do a better job of saving her. I couldn’t really latch on to her.

It’s a bear!” I opened my front door, and there was a 275-pound polar bear sitting on its haunches with a woman in its mouth, waving her around like a rag doll. I thought to myself, I’ve got no weapon or anything. Then I saw my shovel sitting there and found myself going to get it. Once I picked it up, I thought, Well, am I going to do anything, or is that woman going to die? So down the steps I went. 
                    When I got over there, I stepped up and hit the bear in the eye. I’d heard this is the best way to fight a bear. He let go of the woman, and she ran into my house. The bear reached out and grabbed ahold of me, and the mauling was on. He tore off my right ear, and I was waiting for him to bite me again. A neighbor fired a shotgun, but it didn’t do any good, so he jumped into his truck and gunned it toward us. I was on my belly on the ground, watching this vehicle speeding our way, and it stopped about two feet away before the bear let me go.

                    I spent seven days in the hospital. They worked on me for four hours one day, to staple my wounds, and then for four hours the next day, putting my ear back on. So I came out of it pretty good.

                    The crash woke me up. Just after midnight, on a very windy Sunday last October, I heard a very loud noise, and it was a large fir tree falling into my yard from the neighbor’s yard. It crushed a greenhouse and took down the tip of a power line as it landed. I’ve been in my house almost 50 years and know how much damage wind and trees can do, but as I was coming downstairs and glanced outside, I was horrified to see brilliant flames outside my window, way up over my head.

                    I live alone­ — my husband died six years ago — and I thought, I have to call 911. But there was no time. I thought, This could go everywhere. It could burn the whole hill. I threw on something over my nightgown, raced outside, grabbed a hose and started spraying water as hard as I could. The wind had already spread the flames to a live oak and then to some blackberry vines on the edge of my driveway. It was really howling now, and I could feel the heat, but I just braced myself and kept on squirting.

                    This must have gone on for five minutes, but it felt like an hour. An architect neighbor smelled smoke and ran over to help. Then the couple across the driveway came, and someone called the fire department. When the fire trucks arrived, they yelled at us to move back, but I couldn’t stop. I said, “We have to keep water on this fire.”

                    I had no idea I had done anything special. People I never met were knocking on my front door the next day, saying, “You’re a hero. You saved the hill.” But I was just the first responder. I saw what I saw, and I took action.

                    Thousands of people lost everything that night in other parts of California. We were fortunate to be spared. But I don’t think it was a miracle. The reality is, my children weren’t there and my husband wasn’t there, and if I wanted to stay in the home I loved, I would have to step up. So I did — but then got a lot of help.

I dressed myself and ran down the stairs in excitement. When I opened the front door to my surprise I found a big box in the middle of the door way. I jumped in joy and ran inside to see my aunties, uncles, brothers, cousins, grandparents and the rest of my family that were already awake.Everyone wanted me to open the box already but I waited till I put it on the table. Oh my goodness I was about to open it when I heard a noise coming from the box. IT WAS A KITTEN AND A PUPPY. I quickly opened it and found an adorable kitten who was all black with ginger and white patches on her. I named her Precious. Aw how cute was she. After that I carefully took my puppy out of the box and held him. He was a little tiny black and white dog with a few patches on him. I chose to name him terror because he tore the box open before I got him out. My family told me that I got my puppy Terror from my male relatives and I got the kitten Precious from my female relatives. The afternoon was here already and I had turned 15 at 12:13PM. My friends came over to celebrate my birthday. When they all got here to my surprise I had found a huge gift from all of them. I opened this card up and found airfares to Sydney and to go to Palm Beach to meet my inspirations, the cast of home and away. " OH MY GOODNESS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY EVER I CAN'T BELIEVE IT" We all went out and had an amazing time. That isn't all you get Jessica. " We are all going out tomorrow before you leave to Sydney with all of your family. "WHAT YOU MEAN I AM LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT WITH MY FAMILY TO GO ON AN AEROPLANE"? "YEP YOU GOT IT RIGHT GIRL". "SEE THIS IS LEGIT THE BEST DAY EVER"I exclaimed. "WE HAVE ALSO GOT YOU TICKETS TO MEET AND GREET ONE DIRECTION AND YOU WILL BE STAYING IN THE SAME HOTEL AS THEM". "WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "I LOVE YOU GIRLS SO MUCH YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME". "Well girly you and your family better start packing because you leave tomorrow night and we are all going out tomorrow to celebrate your 15th". "Alright"! Guess what Jessica. "What"? "That isn't it we haven't told you another surprise. "WHAT IS IT"? "WE ARE COMING TO Sydney ASWELL AS YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF. SO IS TERROR AND PRECIOUS"? "AHHHHHHHH ARE YOU SERIOUS"? "YEP WHY WOULDN'T WE BE"? "WHERE IS PRECIOUS AND TERROR GOING TO STAY"? "WITH YOU". "TERROR AND PRECIOUS ARE STAYING WITH YOU AND WE FLY OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON JETSTAR JQ1314 AT 9:00PM."WHEN WE GET TO SYDNEY EVERYONE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT AND EVERYTHING". The day came and I was super excited. at about 10:30PM we arrived at Sydney airport and it felt so good to be in my favorite place. I mean this was the best birthday ever that I will never ever ever ever forget in a whole life time. Jetstar was an amazing flight and we had the best time ever.

                    Life is full of unexpected surprises. There are many opportunities when one can secretly wish for something exciting to happen – something out of the ordinary. The real surprise is when the wish unexpectedly comes true. I never believed that something like this could ever happen to me; such a thing that would make me stop and look back at the events in awe. I think you would agree that something as simple as being lost in the forest for less than ten minutes should have no influence on my life. If you do agree, that makes both of us wrong.

                    Throughout my childhood, I loved the wild. My family and I would always go for a walk in the downtown forest of Coote’s Paradise. There were many times I thought of what could happen if we were to lose our way from the trail and have to live off of the land until we found our way back to civilization. I thought it would be the greatest experience ever.

                    As my brothers and I grew older, we continued to go for these walks with our parents but the dreams of living in the forest I soon forgot. That’s when it happened. We decided to take a different path off the main trail. Before I knew it, the path had disappeared and no one in my family could tell where we had come from. It was so unexpected. It gave me a feeling of excitement that can’t be described. Everything in the forest seemed different. The trees were a deeper shade of green. The birds chirped in a different tone. Vines covered almost every inch of the ground. One part of me never wanted this moment to end. I felt completely free from the stress of my life outside of the woods. It was this moment that I realized that I would much rather stay here for the rest of my life than go back to society.

                    I think that another reason that I felt carefree was because my parents didn’t panic. They took the situation under control and headed for any open area in hopes to find a map (many of these maps were found throughout the grounds, telling you where you were). From my point of view, at the time, it seemed as if they were excited as I was about losing our way. In the end, it only took my parents ten minutes to find such a map and we were back on the trail in no time.

                    An experience like this made me think about my place in life. I’m the type who loves seeking out adventures. When we were lost, I realized that I had everything I would ever need with me – my family. They’ve always supported me in everything I do. This experience made me realize that families need to stick together; you don’t realize how much you need them until, for a moment, you think they’ll be the last people you see for the rest of your life.

                    It’s incredible how much a simple thing like being lost in a forest for ten minutes will affect your outlook on life. Things like not being able to find your way back to where you came from make you appreciate the little things in life. Looking back on the day, I realize now that it was fate. Moments like that are few and far between and should be taken as a lesson. Surprises like this were, and always will be, an unexpected gift for all.

                    I was full of excitement and very queer to see the new born baby next door. My Mom told that our neighbour, Shanti Bhabhi had given birth to a little fairy, the lakshmi of the home, a baby girl. But suddenly this happiness curve on my face disappeared with the thought of her husband. Shanti's husband, Raju bhaiya who was not a good man. A drunkard by nature, he had never provided that space to his wife and his male chauvinism was fiercely aggressive. I once heard his words in the street to the little daughter of our neighbours that studying and playing doesn't suit girls. They are meant for bangles and making rotis, just like a common male chauvinist. The prevailing awareness of the maltreatment of girls in the media, shook me again. I just wished that this liitle fairy should not face such a treatment and should be brought up on an equality basis with the sons of the same house. But somewhere in the heart the thought took place so firmly that I went to Shanti Bhabhi's house and what I saw next was unbelievable. I saw Raju Bhaiya with his little daughter in his hands and saying that he wished to grew his daughter with all the best education that he can afford. The love and incredibility of the moment rolled down tears from my eyes. I got back to my home relaxing that really the little fairy has brought happiness and a positive change along with a pleasant surprise.

                    After a long bout with Parkinson’s, my Grandmother had passed. And as a pleasant surprise, I was in the will. I had inherited her car, and the ghost that came in the car. That’s right. Grandma’s car was haunted. Her 1980 Chevy Citation was haunted.

                    I was surprised in so many ways. Hell, when I first turned the key I didn’t think that the thing would even start, let alone be haunted. It was an aged hunk of junk, and hadn’t seen much use in the past twenty years. And then when I saw the little figure creeping along the dash, I started to wonder if this was why she chose to stop driving it; and not because of the glaucoma.

                    I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find something that wasn’t static, when it came. It was tiny, the size of my hand. It was the classic ghost. Literally, the classic ghost. In a little white sheet (a handkerchief, really) with tiny holes where the eyes and mouth would be. I couldn’t see any feet beneath the hem of the shroud, but it seemed to have tiny little hands poking up as it levitated towards me. And as it came drifting along, it was making a little ethereal ‘whooooooo’ sound at me.

                    It was freaking adorable.

                    I mean, come on. It was like a kindergarten Halloween decoration had come to life and came to visit. It was so little! It was smaller than the rat I had when I was in college. It was smaller than my breakfast sandwich. I wanted to pet it.

                    I suppose in retrospect, yeah. I should have been a little more respectful. Maybe taken it a little bit more seriously. Seeing visible proof of the afterlife, actual confirmation of existence after death… well, that’s serious stuff. And, one would think, deserved more respect than the delirious giggles I wasn’t holding back.

                    I think even the little ghost was actually taken aback by this. It stopped mid-‘whoo’ and kind of stared at me. It just drifted in place, bobbing like a floater in the corner of your eye.

                    And there I sat, snickering and crouched back against the driver’s side door of the old Citation. The car still smelled like Vicks and old menthol cigarettes, the defining scents of my dear old Grandma.

                    Was this Grandpa, maybe? Could it be? My mind raced. Grandma never spoke much of her ex-husband, just that he was a son of a bitch and that he had gotten his ‘just desserts’. Did his ‘just desserts’ involve being murdered and cursed to haunt a handkerchief on his jilted wife’s dashboard? But then I remembered mom saying that her dad had just jumped ship and moved to Iowa, where he had died in 1979.

                    So my theory was obviously sunk. I peered at the little thing, static from the dusty old radio an idle buzz in the back of my mind. The ghost just bobbed in the warm air beneath the windshield, occasionally emitting little ‘Whooo’s!’ at me. I didn’t think it was trying to scare me anymore.

                    Then a much more troubling idea occurred to me. What if this thing was my grandmother? Oh, now that’s a terrible thought. I couldn’t think of a worse fate than being doomed to spend the rest of eternity haunting the interior of a mid-80’s compact.

                    And worse, if this was my Grandma’s spirit then I’d feel especially guilty taking the Citation to the junkyard to sell for parts.

                    I had to know. I sat in thought for a moment, then came to a resolution. I was going to see exactly who — or what — this thing really was. I sat up in the drivers seat, steeled myself. I reached out towards the little ghost with my fingers trembling.

                    I won’t lie to you, I was terrified. At first I thought the whole thing was kind of funny, this little cutesy ghost the size of half a donut. But the prospect of what could be under that little white sheet, that scared the hell out of me. I didn’t want to see my undead Grandma, pale and shrunken and horribly shriveled after death. I wanted Grandma to be in heaven with Great-Uncle Al, and all of her dogs, and her one cat that I had liked.

                    As I slowly reached out my shaking hand, it actually reached out to me a little bit. I was startled, and snatched my hand back a little bit. But I focused, and mentally pushed my hand forward again. I had to know.

                    I yanked up the little white sheet with my eyes shut tight, and after a second I slowly eased them open so that I could see who — what — it was.

                    I didn’t know the guy.

                    I ended up making four hundred bucks at the junkyard. Which was another pleasant surprise

                    I had got the money by work done at home, out of office hours. It came to four pounds altogether. At first I thought I would use it to discharge a part of our debt to Eliza’s mother. But it was very possible that she would send it back again, in which case the pence spent on the postal orders would be wasted, and I am not a man that wastes pennies. Also, it was not absolutely certain that she would send it back. I sent her a long letter instead–my long letters are almost her only intellectual pleasure. As for the four pounds, I reserved two for myself, for any incidental expenses, and decided to give two to Eliza. I did not mean simply to hand them to her, but to get up something in the way of a pleasant surprise.

                    I had tried something of the kind before. Eliza once asked me for six shillings for a new tea-tray that she had seen. I went and stood behind her chair, and said, “No, dear, I couldn’t think of it,” at the same time dropping the six shillings down the back of her neck. Eliza said it was a pity I couldn’t give her six shillings for a tea-tray without compelling her to go up-stairs and undress at nine o’clock in the morning. It was not a success.

                    However, I had more than one idea in my head. This time I thought I would first find out if there was anything she wanted.

                    So on Sunday at tea-time I said, not as if I were meaning anything in particular, “Is there anything you want, Eliza?”

                    “Yes,” she said; “I want a general who’ll go to bed at half-past nine and get up at half-past five. If they’d only do that, that’s all I ask.”

                    “You will pardon me, Eliza,” I said, “but you are not speaking correctly. You said that was all that you asked. What you meant—-“

                    “Do you know what I meant?”

                    “I flatter myself that I know precisely—-“

                    “Then if you know precisely what I meant, I must have spoken accurately.”

                    But as we went to church I discovered that she wanted a new jacket. Her own was trimmed rabbit, and had been good, but the fur had gone bald in places.

                    * * * * *

                    Next morning I wrote on a sheet of note-paper, “To buy a new jacket. With your husband’s love.” I folded the two sovereigns up in this, and dropped the packet into the pocket of Eliza’s old jacket, as it hung in the wardrobe, not telling her what I had done. My idea was that she would put on the jacket to go out shopping in the morning, and putting her hand in the pocket, get a pleasant surprise. As I was leaving for town, she asked me why I kept on smiling so mysteriously. I replied, “Perhaps you, too, will smile before the day is over.”

                    On my return I found Eliza at the front door. “Come and look,” she said, cheerfully. “I have got a pleasant surprise for you.” She flung open the drawing-room door, and pointed. In the middle of the table stood a spiraea, a most handsome and graceful plant. It stood in one of the best saucers, with some coloured paper round the pot, and the general effect was very good. I at once guessed that she had bought it for me with the change from my present to her, and thought it showed very good feeling in her.

                    “I hope you have not given too much for this,” I said.

                    “I didn’t give any money for it.”

                    “I don’t understand.”

                    “Well, you must know I had a present this morning.”

                    “Of course I know.”

                    “Did mother tell you? Yes, she has sent me a beautiful new jacket. Then a man came round with a barrow of plants, and he said he didn’t want money if I had any clothes to spare. So I gave him my old worn-out jacket for this spiraea, and—-“
                    I remembered that I had seen the man with the barrow farther down the street.

                    “Excuse me for one moment, Eliza,” I said, and dashed out after him.

                    * * * * *

                    He was a big, red-faced man, and he made no difficulty about it at all.

                    “Yes,” he said, “I bought that jacket, gov’ner, and I don’t deny it. There it is at the bottom of my bundle, and I ain’t even looked at it since. Nor I ain’t goin’ to look now. You say there was two suvreigns in the pocket. A gent like you don’t want to swindle a common man like me. If you say the two suvreigns was there, then they’re there now, and I can return yer two pound out o’ my own, in a suttunty of gettin’ ’em back out o’ the jacket pocket. Bless yer! I knows an honest man when I sees one.”

                    With these words he drew the money from his own waistcoat pocket, and handed it to me. I took it with some reluctance.

                    “Hadn’t you better make quite certain—-“

                    “Not a bit,” says he. “If them suvreigns were there when the jacket were ‘anded to me, they is there now. I could see as you was a man to be trusted, otherwise I’d ‘ave undone the bundle and searched long afore this.”

                    * * * * *

                    “What have you been doing?” said Eliza, on my return.

                    “Never mind. Your mother has given you a new jacket. Let me have the pleasure of giving you a new hat.” I pressed the two coins into her palm.

                    She looked at them, and said, “You can’t get a hat for a halfpenny, you know, dear. What did you rush out for just now? And why did you have these two farthings gilded? You’ll be mistaking them for sovereigns, if you’re not careful. Were you trying to take me in?”

                    I did not quite see what to say for the moment, and so I took her suggestion. I explained that it was a joke.

                    “You don’t look much as if you were joking.”

                    “But I was. I suppose I ought to know if any man does. However, Eliza, if you want a new hat, anything up to half a sovereign, you’ve only to say it.”

                    She said it, thanked me, and asked me to come and help her water the spiraea.

                    “It’s such a shapely spiraea,” she said.

                    “Yes,” I answered sadly, “it’s a regular plant.” And so it was, though I had not been intending what the French call a double entendre at the time

                    “Surprises are beautiful because they come without waiting.” Not so true for Nancy though. She was sure her sister was planning a surprise for her birthday. Pulling open the pink pastel curtains of her bedroom window,  she hungrily drank in the fresh morning air. Her eyes were laced with longing. A soft smile slid across her lips which were otherwise dry with sadness and coated with grief.  Nancy was turning 30 today. “Keep calm. It’s only your 30th birthday”. Humming her favourite song in her head, her lips pursed in, Nancy ran her fingers over her thin wavy short hair. No a strand of grey! Many of her friends were already showing mini zebra stripes in their heads. But, not her! Thank goodness for that.

                    She quickly glanced at the mirror and looked away. She never liked looking at the mirror. It always reminded her of what she was not. “Life is just a mirror and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you.” Wally “famous” Amos. Turning her face away from the mirror like it was an enemy on the prowl, a single glossy tear flowed down her cheek. Clutching the ends of her dress, she poured them back in again. She was not going to think of the past and all that it had done to her. She held her palms up and looked at them. Shrivelled walnuts were what they looked like. Lifeless, yet useful. “Nothing worth having, comes easy.”

                    All these years she had worked at different factories, clothes, metals, chemicals, shoe, scrubbed the floors at big hotels where perfumed men and women floated easily.  Ever since their parents died, her only goal was to educate Kate, her younger sister. Her emotions came running back to the present. Quickly, she wiped her dried tears and rushed some chirpy cheer on her face. She paced to the door and back.

                    “A sister is a little bit of childhood that can never be lost.” Kate was her dream, her hope, her happiness. The gleam of a thousand stars shone on her face as she thought of her sister. Her precious possession. She meant everything to her. She was all she had. Kate shined liked a diamond in a heap of coal. She was an outstanding student and an obedient younger sister. And today, Nancy was sure Kate would surprise her like she did every year. Nancy’s nostrils swelled open in anticipation of the sweet aroma of the freshly baked chocolate cake that would welcome her. Her tongue was eager to lick up the soft, brown cream and her teeth were ready to bite into Kate’s inviting delicacy. She stretched her ears with her hands to hear the sound of Kate’s footsteps coming towards her. She clapped her hands and giggled at her own act of childishness.
                    She waited and waited.

                    It seemed like an endless wait and a tide of emotions were rushing through Nancy. Finally, she heard her younger sister approaching her room. Her eyes lit up, her steps turned into a spring and her heart grew all  bouncy. She sniffed the air to catch a whiff of the chocolate cake but it was missing. Maybe it was not chocolate flavour this time, she imagined with pride intruding her thoughts. Her sister was all grown up now. She could surprise her with something else.

                    Kate walked into her room empty handed. No cake, no flowers, no package wrapped in shiny golden paper, tied with red ribbons. The excitement dissolved from Nancy’s face. Her face looked like a blank, crumpled, white page. Kate was smiling. She could win the world with the radiance of her smile. She gave her sister a tight hug. “Happy birthday” said Kate. Nancy loosened herself from the warm embrace and looked at her sister. “Thank you” she said, smiling coldly. “And here’s your gift” Kate handed her a brown envelope. Nancy’s eyebrows shot up like mountain peaks and her eyes were flooded with questions.

                    “Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love is by far the truest type of love. This is your admission letter to the community college. I want you to pick up from where you left.”

                    Nancy’s eyes grew moist and her trembling hands were silenced by Kate’s firm grip over them. Nancy shut her eyes tight and let her tears flow as she folded her hands in prayer. Kate’s words sparkled with happiness and shined with guilt as she said “You deserve much more my dear sister, but this is all I can give you.”

I visualised and wished that I would get some big surprise as a birthday gift from the Universe and then I completely forgot about it. But just 15 days before my birthday I was diagnosed with Typhoid. On the day of my birthday I was very weak, bedridden and taking my pills and eating only boiled food. I was unable to talk over the phone so no one called me and my family thought it was not appropriate to bring me cake as I was unable to eat it. It was my birthday evening and I was at home feeling dull.

                    The Universe never forgets your wish, and it did not forget mine either, so then it happened. All my friends came over to my place and gave me a big birthday surprise! They brought the cake and a gift which was a branded Jacket, which was also one of my wishes. I had an awesome time with them and felt so happy.

                    Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin. To everyone's surprise, there were no questions....just a black dot in the center of the page.

No one wrote about the white part of the paper. Everyone focused on the black dot - and the same happens in our lives. We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.
                    
                    Our life is a gift given to us by God, with love and care, and we always have reasons to celebrate - nature renewing itself everyday, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see everyday.
                    
                    However we insist on focusing only on the dark spots - the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friend and so on.
                    
                    The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds. Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life.

                    been meticulously preparing for this event, designing every aspect
                    of the party from the invitations to the food, and she was very excited
                    about it.
                    Family members whom Guermo hadn’t seen in years were flying in from Peru in
                    a few days. Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
                    from various places across the country. The caterer and band were set.
                    The best part for Liz: she knew Guermo did not have a clue about the party. She
                    could not wait to see the look on his face when he walked into a big “Surprise!” in
                    his own home.
                    The party was to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about picking
                    relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to their hotel, Guermo
                    walked into the kitchen and said, quite certainly, “Sweetheart, I don’t want
                    anything special done for my birthday.”
                    “What do you mean?” Liz responded nonchalantly, though her heart began to
                    pound.
                    “I mean that I don’t want a surprise party.”
                    “Okay,” Liz said with a shrug. “Not a problem.”
                    Liz’s mind raced. There was nothing she could do about Guermo’s request now.
                    And, frankly, she didn’t want to. Liz had been planning this for more than a year.
                    The party would go off as she intended. She did not want all of her effort to be for
                    naught.
                    When Guermo came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends,
                    he was shocked. Tears filled his eyes. (This response was something Liz had not
                    predicted.) Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in nearly 20
                    years and family members who had come from Peru just for this evening.
                    But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry with his wife. He
                    felt ambushed. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like people to
                    see him that way. That was why he did not like being surprised.
                    Salsa music filled the home of Liz and Guermo. Guests filled up on ceviche, lomo
                    soltado and empanadas. Liz whispered “I love you” in Guermo’s ear, they shared
                    a kiss, and the two danced the night away.

                    Once upon a time a plump old woman name Tante Adela lived in French Canada.  She lived all alone with her big grey cat and the cows in her barn.

                    One morning she got up very early as it baking day and there was much to do.  She took a load of wood outside to her oven. 

                    “Now why would oven door be open?” she said.  She poked a stick inside to see that no leaves or twigs had blown in.  But the stick would not go far – something was in there!

                    The old woman bent over to look in.  When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut. She ran out of her yard and down the road as fast as she could.

                    When she saw what she saw, Tante Adela slammed the oven door shut.

                    At Felix Bell’s farm, she saw the neighbor drawing a bucket of water from the well.

                    “Felix, Felix!” she called out. “Come quick!  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                    “Are you sure?” said Felix.  “Maybe it is your cat.”

                    “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down his back?”

                    “I will come as soon as I draw this bucket of water,” said Felix.

                    Tante Adela turned and dashed back to the road.  She headed for the next farm, the farm of Louis Ross.  After all, three heads are better than two.

                    “Of course I am sure!” said Tante Adela.  “Does my cat have a white stripe down its back?”

                    “Louis, Louis!” she cried, out of breath.  “Come right away!  There is a skunk in my oven.”

                    “A skunk?” said Louis. “Are you sure it is not a scrap of old fur coat you may have thrown away by mistake?”

                    “Why would I throw away a fur coat?” said Tante Adela.  “Am I the kind of person who would do that?”

                    “You have a point,” said Louis Ross.  “I will come over as soon as I have finished feeding the chickens.”

                    The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                    “Samuel, Samuel!” she cried out.  “You must come to my farm.  There is a skunk in my oven!”

                    “Are you sure?” said Samuel.  “Maybe you saw a shadow inside as you opened the door.”

                    The old woman turned to the road and limped to the farm of Samuel Roy.

                    “Does a shadow have a bushy tail?” said Tante Adela.  “Does a shadow grit its teeth at me and snark?  I don’t think so!”

                    “I will come right over,” said Samuel.  “Just as soon as I finish weeding the garden.”

                    So Tante Adela went from farm to farm looking for help.  By the time she made it back home, Felix and Louis were already there.  Soon after, Samuel came too, and others who had heard about the skunk in Tante Adela’s oven.

                    “Yep, there’s a skunk in there all right,” said Madame Ross, who had opened and closed the door.

                    “I know that!” said Tante Adela.  “The question is, what to do about it?”

                    “I will run home and get my gun,” said Felix. “That will take care of that!”

                    “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                    “She will not be able to bake bread in there for a month!” said Madame Roy, and everyone agreed.

                    “No, no!” cried Tante Adela.  “Think of the smell!”

                    “And it would spoil the pelt,” said Samuel.  He trapped for furs and knew what he was talking about.

                    “What if we got a dog?” said Alice, the daughter of Samuel and Madame Ross.  “A dog will bark.  Maybe that will scare the skunk out of the oven.”

                    “If the skunk gets scared,” said Tante Adela, “think of what it would do!”

                    “What if we get a piece of meat and tie it to a string?” said someone else.  “The skunk will come out on its own when it smells it.”

                    “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                    So this plan was dropped.  No one else cared to use their own meat to lure the skunk out of the oven if Tante Adela wasn’t going to use hers.

                    “I have no meat,” snapped Tante Adela.  “And if I did, I would surely not waste it on a skunk!”

                    “Oh, woe is me!” wailed Tante Adela. 

                    By then, everyone was getting bored with the question of the skunk.  And it did not look as if Tante Adela was going to serve any food or drink for everyone who had come.  Soon Felix Bell and his wife remembered they had to milk the cows.  Louis Ross said he must get back to clean the barn.  And one by one, everyone found a reason to head home.

                    At this time, Tante Adela saw Jules Martel come into the yard.  The young man may be simple-minded, she thought.  Still, who else could she turn to for help?

                    “Jules!” she said.  “Jules Martel.  There is a skunk in my oven.  Can you get him out without scaring him?”
                    stop
                    What would you do to try and get the skunk out of the oven?

                    Jules nodded his head.  He walked over to the oven.  He opened the door and leaned inside.  He spoke in a low voice.  No one could tell what he was saying.  At last he stepped back.  Then the sharp face of the skunk stuck out of the oven doorway.  Everyone stepped back a few feet.  The skunk wiggled its way over the edge, and dropped to the ground.

                    Slowly the skunk made its way through the yard, holding its head high.  And it headed into the woods, where it disappeared.

                    Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                    “How did you get him to come out?” said Samuel to Jules.

                    Tante Adela was thrilled.  All the others were amazed.

                    “What DID you say to it?” said someone else.

                    “I just told him,” said Jules, swinging his arms back and forth, “that if he stayed in the oven any more, he would begin to smell like Tante Adela’s bread.  And if that happened, none of the other skunks would come near him.”

                    “Who would have guessed?” Samuel Roy shook his head. “That a low creature like a skunk cares about what others creatures like him think of him.”

                    “I suppose all creatures must have some sense of self-respect,” said Alice Roy, “no matter who they are.”  Alice Roy and the others nodded in silence

                    In just three days, it will be Christmas. Despite the bright and cheery decorations twinkling in the streets, wreaths on doors, and Christmas trees peeking through windows, Hector doesn't feel one drop of joy or excitement. The magic of Christmas seems to have evaporated this year. People passing one another on the street do not wish each other Happy Holidays, smile, or even make eye contact. They simply rush by with their heads down and eyes straight ahead, their minds preoccupied with their to-do lists and avoiding human interaction. 

                    Hector doesn't even feel Christmas Spirit from his own family. This morning, he woke up excited to decorate the family Christmas tree with his mother as they did every year. They had barely started wrapping the lights when the phone rang. "Oh dear, it's Aunt Susan!" Hector's mother exclaimed. "Go on without me. I’ll be back." Hector finished the whole tree by himself by the time his mother was off of the phone with her sister. Later that afternoon, Hector's father cancelled their plans to play basketball together. Even Hector's older brother, Yohan, was too busy playing video games to help Hector make shortbread cookies for the family. 

                    Feeling discouraged by the lack of festivity around the village and his home, Hector snuggles up with his most comfortable blanket and lets out an enormous sigh. He turns off the light and falls asleep. 

                    That night Hector's Native American grandmother, Tallulah, pays him a visit in his dream. Around eight months ago, she left Hector's family to join the great white falcon in the sky. In her gentle voice, she whispers: “Hector, it's up to you to reinvent the magic of Christmas. You can change things. Search in your heart and you’ll find the solution.”

                    When he wakes up, Hector cannot stop thinking about his dream. “Reinvent the magic of Christmas,” Tallulah said. He thinks about her words and jots down ideas on a sheet of paper, but crosses them out one by one. Suddenly, his face lights up.

                    After lunch, Hector hangs a “do not disturb” sign on the door of his bedroom, closes the curtains, and sits down in his laboratory. This little corner of his room is equipped with a big lamp, magnifying glass, and all the materials from the chemistry set his parents got him for his birthday.

                    All afternoon, Hector experiments with various combinations of Christmas ingredients. He melts candy canes and spices into little bowls, then mixes them with some of the plant oils that his grandmother Tallulah handed down to him. The liquid smells pepper-minty and delicious, and Hector feels a rush of optimism. Perhaps this is it! He takes the bowl in his hand and offers a sniff to Zephir, his big striped cat. Zephir's first sniff sends him into a spiral of sneezes. He sniffs the potion once more, then lies down on his back with his feet directly in the air. Hmmmm. Must need some work, thinks Hector. He adjusts the quantities, replaces some of the peppermint with other Christmas ingredients. He looks at Zephir and lets out a joyful shout. 

                    Licorice, chocolate chips, cinnamon, star anise powder, three drops of Ayahuasca, a drop of the small seed of Nahele, and two drops of moonflower. He discovered the Christmas Spirit elixir formula!

                    Using colored paper from his mother’s desk, Hector cuts, folds, and glues. He makes thirty red, green, blue, yellow, and purple envelopes into which he carefully applies two drops of Christmas Spirit elixir. On each card, he places a sticker of a little elf with a sentence written in capital letters.

                    The next day after lunch, Hector gets on his bike. Along each street in the village, he slips a colored envelope under the door of the first house on both the left and right side of every street. Once he finishes all his rounds, Hector returns home. He sits down on his bed and waits. When it's 5 o’clock, he tip-toes downstairs, checks to make sure that no one is looking, then quietly opens the front door and slips outside. Then Hector then walks back into the house, pretending to have just returned home and discovered the little red letter. “Mom, Dad, Yohan, come quick!” He calls. 

                    When all four of them are standing together in the living room, Hector reads the label aloud. “Open this letter as a family. After opening me, you should close me again and slip me under the door of the neighbor to your right.”

                    The family bubbles with curiosity. Hector's mother grabs the envelope and opens it. A strong scent of chocolate, spice, and incense floats across the living room. Hector's parents and brother stand completely still as the delicious scent surrounds them. Suddenly they begin to move, their eyes sparkling, large smiles slowing spreading across their faces. Hector's father begins to dance, grabbing Hector's mother's hand and twirling her to music only they can hear. They both hum and looking lovingly into one another's eyes. Yohan grabs Hector and lifts him above his head, then begins to spin him around as he used to do when Hector was little. 

                    “How about we take the scooters to go look at some Christmas decorations around town?” Hector's mother blurts out, smiling from ear to ear. 

                    The family bundles themselves in hats and scarves and coats and rush outside. His brother takes the red scooter, and his father the blue one.

                    “Come on, princess, get into my carriage.” Hector's father says to Hector's mother. 

                    “Wait!” his mother says. She runs back into the house and grabs the red envelope. When she comes out into the cold again, her husband and two sons are circling around on their scooters. 

                    Hector's mother runs across the lawn and stuffs the letter underneath the neighbor's door. She rings doorbell three times and shouts, “Merry Christmas!”

                    Then all four of them speed down the street, Hector holding on to his big brother's waist and Hector's mother holding onto Hector's father. Both scooters slide over a large patch of ice, then shoot quickly into a pile of snow. Hector's parents roar with laughter. Hector holds his brother tight.

                    Everywhere they go, the village is topsy-turvy. Hector chuckles to himself. His elixir is working! Mrs. Gari and Mrs. Dubois have finally stopped arguing and are building a snowman together, their cheeks rosy with laughter.  The mailman has switched out his black coat for a bright red one. His mailbag filled with candy, and he shouts "Merry Christmas!" as he slings sweet treats out to everyone he passes. On Lilas Street, the family joins an enormous snowball fight. Grown-ups and children alike launch snowballs at one another. Everyone is dodging, jumping, laughing and rolling. On Cerfs Street, a group is playing hide-and-seek among the piles of snow they were once preoccupied with removing from their walkways. Others are sledding, and others are blowing up balloons and releasing them into the chilly afternoon air. Delicious aromas of hot chestnuts, crepes, and nougat float throughout the village. At the large church down the hill, the carousel is all lit up and spinning around. Mostly adults are on it and bob up and down to the happy sound of the music. Hector's father and mother rush over to the merry-go-round. Hector spots his teacher on the ride, sitting in a big fire truck. Hector waves to him with a huge smile.

                    His brother walks towards him holding two huge servings of cotton candy. They both sit down on the bench across from the dazzling Christmas tree. While enjoying his treat, Hector smiles. In all the eyes that meet his, there is that little spark that shines, a little spark of happiness that tastes like childhood. “Thank you, Tallulah,” he whispers quietly.

                    Today is Ruby’s eighth birthday. Ruby does not know that her parents have arranged a circus party at her grandparents' house. Many of Ruby’s friends are invited to the party. Her little brother John helped his mum make the cake and the cupcakes.

                    When Ruby woke up, she yawned. “It’s my birthday today,” she said. She ran down from her room into the kitchen. When Ruby’s mum heard her she hid the cake and the cupcakes. “Happy Birthday Ruby, we are going to take you to a surprise outing today.” “Yes!” Ruby cried, she was so excited.

                    Ruby ran to her room and put on her gold sparkly dress, her gold sparkly shoes and a gold headband. She wore her favourite butterfly necklace. It was then time to go.

                    Ruby hopped into the car and was amazed as there were balloons and streamers, and her seat was decorated in gold sparkles like a throne. Ruby wondered where her mum, dad and brother were taking her. As she looked outside the window she saw a beautiful rainbow in the bright blue sky, twinkling through the branches. “Hang on a minute,” Ruby said when the car stopped. "We are at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.” Grandma and Grandpa greeted Ruby outside the house. “Happy Birthday Ruby, please come inside,” they said.

                    As Ruby walked inside the house she saw steamers and balloons everywhere. Ruby then walked into the backyard and was startled when she saw a big red tent with blue and yellow spots. “What is that? Oh my goodness, it’s a circus,” she cried. She walked into the tent and gasped as she saw many of her school friends. She saw Abigail, Amelia, Ella, Zara, Holly, Hannah, Abby, Elie, Cameron, Monique, Amy, Stephanie, Olivia, Maddison, Brianna, Isabella and her bestfriend Grace. They were all so excited to see Ruby.

                    Ruby and her friends ran outside and started playing with her grandparents' dog, Rusty. Rusty was a nice puppy dog that didn’t bite anyone but loved to bite the red striped socks on the washing line.

                    The big Jacaranda tree was decorated with sparkly streamers. Under the tree there was a picnic blanket set up with a plate of sandwiches for her and her friends. They all sat together and enjoyed their lunch. Once they finished they heard Grandma call out, “Its time for the circus.” They ran into the tent.

                    Inside the tent they saw Grandma dressed as an Acrobat and Grandpa was dressed like a Ringmaster. They started to giggle. A man then walked into the tent with two ponies. Grandpa and the man helped all the children have turns riding on the ponies. After everyone had a turn on the pony, a lady walked in with a big trapeze. The lady helped Grandma swing on the trapeze. Everybody cheered and clapped for Grandma. Then everyone had a turn on the trapeze. They were having a wonderful time.

                    When it was time to cut the cake, they all went outside where they saw a big pink circus cake set up on a table under the sparkly tree. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to Ruby. They all had a piece of cake and cupcakes with ice-cream.

                    When everyone had left, Ruby ran up to her mum, dad, brother, grandma and grandpa and told them that it was the best birthday she had every had and gave them lots of hugs and kisses.

However, she kept showing silent or sometimes not so silent resistance to any new activity type, and I was becoming increasingly frustrated.

                    After one particularly aggravating incident when she called in sick 30 min after I gave her a new task, I knew we could no longer continue this way. I was planning to have a very tough talk with her and tell her off.

                    Fortunately, just then, the Harvard Business Review’s “Why leading with compassion is a better managerial tactic than toughness” article came to me in one of a multitude of serendipitous moments that are sprinkled through my life. It reminded me of something that I already knew well but had for a moment, forgotten in my anger – compassion in leadership promotes employee trust and loyalty.

                    With my regained balance, I called her and we started talking. It was still a difficult conversation centered around two areas – what are the reasons for her resistance and what she wants to achieve in our team. Lisa shared that she was a perfectionist and had a strong fear of not completing her tasks as per my expectations and the training she received for her new activities was not sufficient to make her feel confident. She also complained that her current workload does not allow her to take on anything new (which was partially true). She had big ambitions for professional growth, but she did not seem to make the connection that to achieve them, she would need to keep expanding her responsibilities and learning new things. I directed the conversation there and clearly told her that she could not expect growth within my team unless she steps up. It was a stern message to deliver, and I am sure – a difficult one to hear.

                    After the conversation, I arranged additional training for her and redistributed some of her work, but honestly, I was not sure she would make it. She had to overcome a deeply instilled fear of failure, and I could not predict whether she would manage.

                    Time passed, their new supervisor joined and I stepped back. I could not observe Lisa’s progress very closely anymore, but I noticed that she is taking on more and more responsibilities. I was hesitant to broach the subject with her because I was afraid I would jinx her headway.

                    Until a couple of weeks ago, when we had our regular skip-level meeting and she started the conversation with, “Marta, I have been waiting for this conversation. I wanted to tell you that I am not afraid of new things anymore. I realized that the only way you develop is by learning new things. And now when there is a new task, I just go, “bring it on.””

                    Let me tell you – I did not stop smiling for three days after that. Fear of failure is one of the most crippling emotions one can experience. And I should know – I have been battling it all my life. But Lisa had managed to shift her focus to her desire for success instead and to keep moving forward. I see a bright future for her in our team.

                    Vulnerability is risky on many levels. And it does not help that as managers, we are often taught that vulnerability is a sign of weakness and can damage our professional reputation. Melinda was brought up as a leader in precisely that way. She thought she should focus all work interactions entirely on operational tasks, issues and resolutions. While she gladly accepts others’ vulnerability and is very attuned to their emotions, sharing her own goes against her professional image of herself.

                    This approach has brought her excellent results and much success. Still, over time she started realizing that she is not getting everything she needed from her relationships with her manager, her team and her colleagues. She often felt misunderstood and increasingly unhappy.

                    Progressively, despite her conditioning to always seem in control and never talk about her own emotions and needs, she started realizing that she would never achieve full job satisfaction unless she opened up. And since this required a great leap of courage, she did it in one big move – in the course of one week, she had meetings with her manager, her team and some of her stakeholders. During those meetings, she, for the first time, managed to express her own feelings and intimate thoughts about her work relationships and her job. She talked about the issues she struggled with and showed up as a human being and not just a manager and professional.

                    Since this is not a fairy tale, I cannot lie that everything magically changed after those meetings and now all those relationships are perfect and completely satisfactory for her. But she did open doors for conversations that would never be possible before, and that could eventually lead her to a place of comfort and trust.

                    Now, I am often annoyed at people who quote their children and find some profound and deep meaning in everything the kid does or says. But my son is special and very wise (ask anyone who knows him).

                    Three years ago, he and his friends encountered an aggressive dog and overnight, he was utterly terrified of anything with a tail. He would cross the street if he would see even a puppy approaching and if a dog got near him, he would scream and jump a mile high.

                    This went on for a few months and then Benton appeared. Benton was a small white dog with a brown tail and was my son’s first imaginary friend (he read this and said that Benton was brown with a white rump, but that is not how I remember it). Later he had others too – a cat, a horse, a tiger, an invisible boy. At some point, they went up to eight and it was pretty crowded at home. But Benton was the first one and stayed with us the longest. My son was able to explain what the dog was currently doing at any given moment, and we talked about him often. We even wrote one and a half books about him (I got lazy after that).

                    Over time, when we met a dog, after the initial scream, he would look at it and start finding similarities with Benton and show more and more interest in dogs. Two years after Benton came into our lives, my son was able to spend time with dogs and even play with them occasionally. He is still not their biggest fan (we are cat people in our house), but he feels quite comfortable with our friends’ very real dog who lives in our shared yard.

                    There is a technique widely used in cognitive therapy called desensitization. It involves controlled exposure to anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus, starting with low intensity and increasing it gradually. I had tried to do that with real dogs, but apparently, no matter how slowly I thought I was moving, it was still too much for him. So he decided to start his desensitization himself with something he can bear – an imaginary dog.

                    See, I told you he was wise.

                    Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark.

                    One day her Aunt Valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her Aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened.

                    "A great many times, Marina," answered her Aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment".

                    Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark?

                    "I'll tell you a secret, Marina. It was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. They can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened".
                    "It's true!" said Marina, intrigued, "Can you tell me that secret?"
                    "Of course! The secret is to change your eyes. Since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. All you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. Shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. Let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. But do it using your hands as eyes... and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear".

                    Marina accepted, but she was rather worried. She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this. When her parents took her to bed, she herself put out the light. After a little while, she felt afraid of one of the shadows in the bedroom. Following the advice of Aunt Valerie, she closed the eyes of her face and opened the eyes of her hands. And, summoning up all her courage, she went over to touch that mysterious shadow...

He answered him that he did not weep for fear, but he was sad about the good darkness that helps others but many fear him. He laughed in the dark and said that he has many and many friends who are never afraid of him and this little boy will be his new girlfriend.

                    People living here before us had died as there was a rumour that there was some kind of spirit in the house ,my father did not believe in all such thing and so didnt I….and so we bought the house but after comming to this house I had a gut feeling that something was wrong about this house i thou did not believe in ghosts was too scared to roam around the until that dreadfull night i can never forget that night because that night changed me completely.

                    It was about 2 in the night when I went down to see as to what was there in the house which troubled me so much moving down i had a torch in one hand a the bible in another i was scared that if the rumours wer right and there was actually a ghost there i would be damned……As I moved forward I looked about the whole hose but couldnt find anything so happy and contentd i startd going back to my room when I suddenly heard a creek of the chair.

                    I was too scared to look back I kept moving forward and so did the foot steps behind me I heard them getting closer to me as they came closer i started to panick sweat was all over my face i dint realise as to wen i fainted and the next morning when i woke up I saw that my parents were sitting beside me my mother looked very tensed….as soon as i saw her i hugged her and started crying I was still shivering at the incident that took place last night but I soon revived from it and was back again in a time of 2-3 months.

                    You have just one more chance to prove you can do it”, the words of my instructor echoed and reechoed in my ears as I got into the plane. Fear was a natural thing, I had heard and I had a common fear which a lot of others had: I was afraid of heights. I had been afraid of even looking down from a high building.

                    This fear had been with me from as long as I could remember. It was to overcome my crippling fear of heights that I had decided to join the parachute school. I had gone through a vigorous routine to prepare myself for the big moment. Than at the signal to jump, I had shivered and trembled and started screaming in fear. The instructor had taken me by the hand and led me back into the plane. I was the only one that day who had taken off in the plane and landed-instead of jumping out of it in a parachute. As my companions met me at the base they smirked. I could see that even my good friends were uncomfortable in my presence. I was a failure.

                    Then my instructor took me aside. He explained that it was not rare to be afraid. The real valor was in facing and overcoming the fear. I nodded and began to engage in self-talk. In the plane I was still doing this. I kept thinking how I was going to go home and face my parents if I did not get my wings. Then I tried to shutout the fear by imagining myself showing them my wings. The time for the jump grew near.

                    The instructor placed his arm on my shoulder to reassure me that I could do it. I nodded and swallowed. My mouth felt dry as I felt the fear arising within me, shiver ran down my spines. I began mumbling affirmations again and then it was my turn. “Jump!” I heard the command and hesitated. “Jump!” shouted the instructor again. I thought no further and took the plunge fairly as I had been drilled.”Bravo” I heard my instructor’s voice in my ears. I fell swiftly and then looked up just in time to see the parachute canopy open above me. Then I looked down.

                    As I looked at the beautiful scenario below me, tears glittered into my deep blue eyes, tears of pure joy. I had won. As I floated I remembered all my drills again and began to control my gliding. When I landed, my comrades were upon me laughing and shouting. I could see that they were as contented as I was that I had overcome the greatest enemy of man that is fear.

                    Later my instructor landed and gave me a large grin.”I knew you could do it,” he said as he slapped my back, His face beamed with astonishment and mirth. I mumbled my thanks as a smile creased my face and then we ran to the truck with a tremendous feeling of elation.

                    “When do we do it again, sir?” I asked the instructor. His reply was drowned in the shouting of my comrades.

                    David had avoided flying on airplanes for most of his life because he found himself terrified of crashing. “I couldn’t stop thinking about all the disasters I heard about on the news, and every time I thought about flying, I would begin sweating and my heart started pounding. I only felt better by avoiding travel altogether.”

                    But as time went on, David’s fear began to prevent him from doing things he wanted to do. He missed his niece’s graduation and an important work conference, and his fear prevented him from taking his family on the vacation to the coast. “After years of avoidance, I realized this fear was holding me back, and I had to do something about it.”

                    David met with a therapist, who encouraged him to examine his thoughts about flying and to question their basis in reality. After some research, David had to admit that his fears about plane crashes were greatly exaggerated in his mind—the flight industry is extraordinarily safe, and accidents are rare. The therapist also taught David some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and visualization, that he could use any time he felt afraid.

                    David decided to stop avoiding his fear, and he booked tickets to take his family on their dream vacation. As the flight took off, David focused on keeping his breathing calm and even. Whenever thoughts about crashing entered his mind, he replaced them with a positive thought about how much fun he would have with his family when they arrived. He closed his eyes and imagined the warm sand and waves lapping at his feet, his children laughing and building a sand castle. As the flight progressed, David began to relax. He even enjoyed looking out the window a bit. Anytime he felt himself getting nervous, he gently turned his attention back to his breathing until the feeling passed.

                    When the wheels touched the ground, he felt something more powerful than relief: “I felt so proud that I had faced my biggest fear head-on. As we landed, I felt like this thing that had such a powerful hold on me for so long had finally loosened its grip. I knew that I would probably still feel some anxiety when flying, but now I had the tools to face it with mindfulness. I finally feel free.”

                story4="""Once a beggar was upset with his life because he had to beg to run his life. He had to beg for everything. He would remain unhappy about this and thought about how his life would change? Thinking that he would be disappointed.

                    Every day he would see that many frustrated people, people with tears in their eyes and troubled by various worries were going towards Gautam Buddha and they were very happy while returning. That beggar could not understand what Gautam Buddha used to do to them so that they would become very happy? While returning there was neither a lot of money in the hands of the people nor gold and silver, then what happened that people were so happy while returning from Buddha?

                    Thinking all this, the beggar also decided that he too will go to Mahatma Buddha and see what is happening there that unhappy people go to him and become happy?

                    He walked to meet Buddha. Where Buddha was present, there was a very long queue, so that beggar also got in the queue. He started waiting in the queue for his turn. His turn came and he reached near Buddha.

                    He said to Buddha, “Buddha I am very poor. I have nothing. I have to beg others even to run my life. Now you tell me that how can I live my life and how can I do it better? “

                    On hearing all this the Buddha said, “You are not poor. You think so because till date you have never done anything for anyone. Neither have you ever donated anything to anyone. Nor have you done anything for others.”

                    Hearing all this, the beggar was in dilemma. To allay his confusion, the beggar asked, “I am a beggar. How can I donate to people and help people? I have to ask others to run my own life.”

                    After hearing all this, Gautam Buddha kept quiet for a while and then said to him, “You have a hand with which you can serve people and do good to others. Also you have mouth so that you say good things and encourage others. You can help others by doing all this. It is not necessary that donations be made only with money. We can also donate education if we want. If the God has given someone a perfectly good body, then he is not poor. He is simply poor in mind. He should move away from this thought and serve others. “

                    After listening to all these things of Buddha, that beggar became very happy and his mind was satisfied now.

                    Moral of the story – We all waste time worrying that we are poor but this is not true. The truth is that as long as our body is completely better, we can use it to move forward and improve our life. If a person just pays attention to his poverty and does not try to change it then he is a fool.

                    Apart from this, we also learn from this story that donations, not only money, education, food, good thoughts, etc. should also be made. If you do not have money, you can education others or you can also share good thoughts to others. This makes society better.

                    There was a garden near the palace of King Śuddhodana(Father of Gautam Buddha) where Siddharth used to sit and enjoy nature. One day while he was sitting in his garden, an injured swan fell near his leg. There was an arrow in his body. On seeing the swan, it seemed that some hunter has hunted him.

                    Seeing the swan in trouble and seeing it fluttering, Siddhartha’s heart melted and he wanted to help the swan.

                    He first took that arrow from the body of that swan and bandaged it with ointment on the injured place. After doing all this, Devdutt came to Siddharth looking for something.

                    As soon as Devdutt approached Siddhartha, he said, “Well, it is with you. Bring it to me. I have hunted it. I had to work very hard to hunt it and I have the right to it.”

                    On hearing this, Siddharth said to Devadatta, “No, this swan was injured and came to me. I helped it and saved his life. That’s why I have the right over it.”

                    There was a debate between the two brothers over the rights of that goose. Now they wanted to know who has more right over that swan? So both of them decided that both of them would go to the king. Siddhartha’s father was the king of Kapilavastu.

                    They both went to the king Śuddhodana. As soon as they reached the king, Devdutt first said, “Maharaj, I have the highest authority over this swan because I have hunted it. Because of this you ask Siddharth to give me this swan.”

                    As soon as Devdutt’s point was completed, the king pacified both and then asked him what was the whole matter?

                    In such a situation, Siddhartha told the king the whole thing and said to him, “Father the thing is that this swan was hunted by Devdutt but this swan got injured and came near my feet. Seeing it injured, I treated it and fixed it. Now tell me that the highest authority on this goose is mine. “

                    The king considered this matter well. After considering it, he said one of the biggest things in the meeting and that was, “the right to save more than the one who is killed is the highest. Therefore, the biggest authority over this swan is only and only for Siddhartha because he save that swan. He did not kill it, but treated that swan after seeing it injured and saved its life. After the king had said this, Devdutt understood the matter very well. He also knew that the protector has more rights than the one who killed.

                    Moral of the story- From this story we understand that the protector is greater than the one who kill and his authority is greater than the one who is killed. That is why we too should help others and help the troubled people. By doing this we make the society around us better. A good society is the hallmark of a good country. That’s why you also pledge from today that you too will definitely help others.

                    The disciple gladly obliged and walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that a few people were washing their clothes in the lake and right at that moment, a bullock cart was crossing through the lake. As a result, the water had become muddy and foul. The disciple couldn’t possibly take the dirty water to Buddha. So he returned to Buddha and told him the water was dirty and not fit to drink.

                    A half hour later, Buddha again told the disciple to get water from the same lake. The disciple, though perplexed, obediently agreed and walked up to the lake. This time, however, the disciple noticed that the water was crystal clean. The mud had settled down and the water was fit to drink. So he collected some water in a pot and took it to Buddha. Buddha looked at the pot of water and smiled.

                    He said, “See what you did to make the water clean? You did nothing. You just let it be. The mud settled on its own and you got pure water. Your mind is exactly like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it some time. It will settle down on its own. You don’t have to put any effort to calm your mind. It will happen. It’s effortless.”

                    Buddha’s message is crystal clear. Achieving inner peace is effortless. It is not something to struggle for. It is an effortless process which will happen on its own. The practice of mindfulness is central to Buddhist philosophy where one observes the thoughts without passing any judgment or reacting to them. There are several mindfulness meditation techniques that can help us in achieving a calm and peaceful state of mind.
